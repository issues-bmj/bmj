Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, MD, PhD, the Hungarian biochemist who received
the 1937 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his discoveries concerning vitamin
C and the citric acid cycle, stated, &#8220;A vitamin is a substance that
makes you ill if you don&#8217;t eat it.&#8221; While this is absolutely true in
context, many have taken its meaning to a level of paranoia, leading to
a high demand for nutritional supplements that may or may not be
beneficial to one&#8217;s health.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the US alone, some 121 million people,
constituting approximately 56 percent of the adult population, have
admitted to using over-the-counter nutritional supplements, often
without consulting a physician. The main reasons behind this high
demand seem to be a response to not reaching the recommended daily
value (RDA) of certain vitamins, often due to an unhealthy diet or busy
lifestyle. There are also circulating rumors that supplements may slow
the aging process or relieve high stress. But is there such an
overemphasis on vitamins, detracting from focusing on other nutritional
concerns?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vitamins are organic compounds required in small
amounts for the human diet in order to carry out many necessary
metabolic roles for normal cell function by acting as hormones,
antioxidants, and coenzymes. Vitamin deficiencies can be serious, as
evidenced by even the earliest cases in 1905 of Beriberi. This
deficiency in vitamin B1 was investigated by William Fletcher, MD,
Institute for Medical Research in Malaysia; he found that it was linked
with eating habits of consuming polished versus unpolished rice.
Perhaps the most well-known example of vitamin deficiency is scurvy,
which is caused by vitamin C deficiency. It was highly prevalent among
sailors, and often treated with a slice of lime every day. The threat
of vitamin deficiency continues today, with the World Health
Organization reporting that every year, an estimated 250,000 to 500,000
children become blind due to vitamin A deficiency, with half of them
dying within 12 months of losing their sight.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United States, where life-threatening vitamin
deficient diseases are less common, many still do not escape the risk.
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 36 percent of
Americans are still vitamin D deficient, placing them at risks of
health conditions such as osteomalacia, the softening of the bones.
This explains why the public is so enamored with nutritious
supplements. If Americans are still vitamin deficient, despite boasting
the highest food consumption rate in the world, vitamin supplements
seem to be the perfect cure-all. Nevertheless, recent researchers are
questioning this solution as many studies show that vitamin
supplements, contrary to their assigned role, may actually increase the
risk of cancer and early mortality.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a review published by the Cochrane Collaboration,
a non-profit organization that systematically reviews the results of
biomedical randomized controlled trials, a study of 67 randomized
trials of vitamin pills was implemented on 232,000 participants, and
the antioxidant supplements (vitamins A, C and E) were found to
actually shorten lifespan rather than prolong it. This challenged
previous conceptions of the vitamins. originally presumed roles:
antioxidants from natural vitamins have been shown to prevent diseases
as well as slow aging by cancelling out the damaging effects of free
radicals on the cells.<br />

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other research warns that vitamins may
increase cancer risks: in a cross-sectional study carried out by
Christopher Slatore, MD, University of Washington, which spanned a four
year period and involved 78,000 adults in the state of Washington,
vitamin E supplements were shown to slightly increase the risk of lung
cancer. Published in the March 2008 issue of the American Journal of
Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the study demonstrated that
with every increase in vitamin E consumption of 100 mg per day, there
was a slight increase of risk in cancer, or a &#8220;28 percent increase in
risk over 10 years for someone taking 400 milligrams of vitamin E
daily.&#8221;<br />
