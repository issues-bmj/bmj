An absence of other senses may at least allow the individual to move
and navigate well without much aid, but the loss of a person&#8217;s vision
can render him or her helpless. Consequently, research facilities spend
millions of dollars developing methods of vision improvement for those.
Glasses, eye drops, and corrective lenses augment mild vision
impairments, but recent technological innovations have introduced the
potential to overcome debilitating diseases that usually cause
permanent damage to visual acuity. Researchers are now trying to
convert that permanent damage into a temporary liability.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second Sight, a Californian company
specializing in prosthetics for visual improvement, developed the first
FDA-approved retinal prosthetic system Argus II. It involves a camera
that captures image data of the surroundings and sends it to a
mini-computer, which further relays that information to a matrix of
electrodes implanted in the patient&#8217;s retina. Currently, the FDA has
only certified the system to aid patients with Retinitis pigmentosa, an
eye impairment that leads to abnormal rods and cones, subsequently
causing a progressive loss of light in the patient&#8217;s field of vision.
Consequently, Argus II accomplishes the restoration of that light.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This remediation, however, seems to be
limited, suggest the eye exams these patients underwent after using the
prosthesis. When asked how their eyesight improved, patients stated
that rather than seeing color, they only visualized a contrast between
images, just enough to distinguish big versus small objects, read large
text, and see slow-moving cars. As a result, the best visual acuity a
user achieved was that of 20/1,260, meaning that an object that person
could see from 20 feet, a healthy individual could perceive 1,260 feet
away. Given the boundary for legal blindness is 20/200 (with corrective
lenses), Second Sight has large improvements to make.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Retina prostheses are at the stage
cochlear implants were 30 years ago. That technology went from being an
aid for lip reading to the point now where children with a cochlear
implant can go through normal school and even use mobile phones.&#8221; Given
that the boundary for legal blindness is 20/200 (with corrective
lenses), the results may not seem great. Nevertheless, given that
technology is improving day by day, the quality of these systems should
increase.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utilizing a strictly biological approach,
David Schaffer, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering,
bioengineering, and neuroscience at UC Berkeley, utilized a virus
called adeno-associated virus (AAV) to cure two genetic diseases of the
eye: retinoschis and Leber&#8217;s Congenital Amaurosis Type II (LCA II).
Retinoschisis causes splitting in the area between the photoreceptors
and the next layer of nerve cells, which leads to a loss of both
peripheral and central vision. LCA II disturbs the communication system
between the eye and the brain neurons, leading to a loss of vision. In
a procedure called an intravitreal injection, Schaffer and his research
team place corrective genes into the virus&#8217;s DNA, and inject it to the
vitreous humor, the gelatinous fluid in the eye. From there, the AAV&#8217;s
travel to the retina and transfer the corrective genetic material to
the cells, improving the subject&#8217;s vision.<br />
