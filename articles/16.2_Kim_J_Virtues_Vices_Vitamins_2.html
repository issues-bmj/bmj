<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from The Virtues and Vices of Vitamins<br />
</small></p>

<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, many scientists still defend the
use of vitamin supplements, at least when it comes to those who really
require it. Folic acid supplements have long been associated in
reducing the risks of neural tube malformations such as spinal bifida
in the growing fetus, and prescriptions are regularly given for
pregnant women who may not reach the recommended 0.4 mg daily level.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have also been research results that indicate
that vitamin supplements may in fact lower the risk of cancer.
According to Edward Gorham, PhD, associate professor of family and
preventive medicine at the University of California at San Diego,
vitamin D supplements have been associated with a decreased risk of
colon and breast cancer in women. Others defend the possible risks that
vitamin C and vitamin E may impose; a study conducted by the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has associated these vitamins
in particular with protection against neurodegenerating diseases such
as Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what are some a good reasons or guidelines to
follow when taking vitamin supplements? Should vitamin supplements be
an option at all?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RDA covers 97-98 percent of nutritional needs,
including essential nutrients that cannot be synthesized by body, of
healthy people by age and gender. This is often converted into DV
(daily values), often shown on nutrition labels regulated by the FDA,
and used as the basic guide for many health educators and dietitians.
But what is its significance? &#8220;People should be concerned when they
don.t reach an average 100 percent of the RDA for each nutrient over a
week&#8217;s time,&#8221; explains Joanne Larsen, a registered and licensed
dietitian, who is also a member of the American Dietetic Association
and the Society for Nutrition Education. &#8220;While some vitamins are fat
soluble and the body stores them, others like the B vitamins and C are
water soluble and not stored by the body so you need to eat them every
day.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the source of these nutrients, Larsen still
sees food as the best option because multivitamin supplements may lack
the bioflavonoids, antioxidants and fiber that are included in the
natural food sources. She does recommend multivitamins for those who
are not consuming less than 1200 calories daily, though. In fact, a
single multivitamin that provides 100 percent of the RDA is considered
harmless. &#8220;The problem is when people start mixing and matching single
nutrients. For instance, excess copper suppresses zinc and vice versa,&#8221;
Larsen asserts. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larsen also agrees that the public is spending too
much on supplements when many do not have any background research on
the products they are buying. In 2007 alone, the total sales of vitamin
supplements were a staggering $7.6 billion, according to the Nutrition
Business Journal. Larsen&#8217;s best recommendations are consulting a
physician on dietitian on evaluating the supplement needs based on
nutritional deficiency. She also notes, &#8220;The Office of Dietary
Supplements provides a good list of supplement benefits that is based
on research.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the recent abuse of vitamins has left
many questioning its continued use. Although vitamin deficiency can
still be a problem in many cases, perhaps relying on vitamin
supplements, which have proven, in several studies, to be damaging to
our health, is not the solution. Rather, people should reconsider
vitamin supplements for a healthier, more rounded diet.<br />
