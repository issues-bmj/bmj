<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Practice Makes Imperfect<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; In their article, &#8220;Evidence-based medicine: an
approach to clinical problem-solving,&#8221; William Rosenberg, D.Phil., a
clinical tutor in medicine, and Anna Donald, M.D., M.P.P., Senior House
Officer of Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, claim that the
many computer skills that are now universal among medical students may
seem daunting to older doctors. Younger doctors are simply more
efficient in searching through online databases. They also write that
older doctors who base their decisions largely on their years of
experience may see evidence-based medicine as a threat. This concern is
even more relevant to authoritarian clinicians in the setting of a
large hospital or a group practice, as the routine use of evidence over
experience may erode hierarchical distinctions based on seniority.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possible solutions include developing more effective
ways to keep doctors up to date and reevaluating current standards in
testing for doctors&#8217; competence. Currently, most boards waive
requirements for renewal of specialty certification for older doctors,
while some boards do not have recertification requirements for doctors
of any age. However, there is a growing trend for stricter
requirements. In emergency medicine, physicians are now required to
take an annual exam that tests their knowledge in order to keep their
certification.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Leaders in the healthcare industry, and mainly, the
doctors themselves, should be spearheading the effort to reform the
current system,&#8221; says Khiem Nguyen, M.D., a cardiologist in
Westminster, California. The consensus among many healthcare
professionals is that neither trusting the doctor&#8217;s own initiative to
keep himself educated nor the distribution of printed information is
effective enough. He agrees with his colleagues that a training and
testing center where physicians can learn the newest theories and
practice with the latest equipment would be very helpful. &#8220;But there
are only so many hours in the day,&#8221; he says. &#8220;With the current system
of healthcare, doctors have to see more patients and spend even more
time with the piling paperwork. The inability of doctors to keep up is
just a symptom of a larger problem.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just how many of us actually believe that
younger doctors provide better care? Christine Le, a student at the
University of California, Berkeley, and her family immigrated to
America from Vietnam a few years ago to seek better medical care for
her father. When asked about the difference between young and old
doctors, she replies, &#8220;I would imagine that younger doctors are more
enthusiastic and energized to make sure that you get the best treatment
possible. The idealized view of the profession they picked up in
medical school would still be fresh in their minds. I think that as the
years go on, doctors end up being more concerned with taking care of
their own interests and stop making the effort to learn new techniques
and theories.&#8221; But when asked the age of the cardiologist she entrusts
with the care of her father, Christine sheepishly shrugs her shoulders.
&#8220;He&#8217;s pretty old. I know what I just said, but my family [and I] still
feel more comfortable with a really experienced doctor.&#8221;<br />
