<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from CyberKnife</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; There are several benefits to the CyberKnife
treatment, the first being that this machine has revolutionized the
ability to access a tumor without the previously associated harms. As
Parvesh Kumar, MD, chairman of the Department of Radiation Oncology at
University of Southern California&#8217;s Keck School of Medicine, explains,
&#8220;It has allowed us to give very high doses of radiation therapy with
incredible precision, within a millimeter, delivered live, without
hardly any side effects.&#8221; With such precision, areas around the tumor
receive a substantially smaller amount of radiation, which is
especially vital in treating sensitive areas like the lungs and brain.
Furthermore, individuals with tumors that were once inaccessible, such
those surrounded by blood vessels or located close to the spine, now
finally have a chance of successful radiation therapy. The side effects
are also minimal; besides the insertion of the catheter for the
placement of the fiducials, there are no incisions or scars and the
patient does not feel the radiation. In fact, the only recorded side
effects are fatigue and nausea. Unlike lengthy surgeries which require
hospital recovery time, each treatment usually consists of four to six
courses which last only an hour. In most cases, this can be done on an
outpatient basis.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, evidence for the success of
CyberKnife is not easily obtainable. As Kristine Gagliardi, vice
president of Clinical Development at the CyberKnife Society, explains,
statistics and tumor shrinkage rates for these types machines are hard
to measure because tumors can differ so greatly in shape, size,
location, and biological makeup. However, the success in terms of
quality of life for CyberKnife patients has been astounding. For
example, spinal cord tumors that are inaccessible by conventional means
can be problematic, causing symptoms like extreme pain and discomfort.
After treating these spinal cord tumors with CyberKnife, patients
notice a dramatic decrease in symptoms, sometimes even as early as a
day or two after their session. Moreover, scientists have also found
that the radiation from CyberKnife greatly complements the effects of
many common types of chemotherapy, making the chemotherapeutic
treatments far more successful.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, Cyberknife has several limitations. Only
tumors that can be readily targeted by the computer system can be
treated and multiple tumors are often hard to control. Additionally,
frequent trips to the hospital are time consuming and costly. David
Larson, MD, of the University of California, San Francisco, hopes to
reduce the duration of treatment sessions from an hour to just five or
ten minutes making the treatment easier and more efficient. Another
limitation, Gagliardi explains, is the diagnostic imaging. Often times,
by the time the tumor can be seen on a computed axial tomography scan
or MRI, it is too late to treat and doctors may not be able to slow its
progression and treat any symptoms.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is in store for CyberKnife in the next ten or
twenty years? &#8220;Well, the future is bright,&#8221; says Dr. Kumar. &#8220;No other
specialty in medicine has seen as much change as radiation oncology in
the past 15 years. The future way of delivering radiation will be based
on the biological activity of the tumor as well as the anatomical
position.&#8221; Moreover, with more sophisticated equipment, CyberKnife
treatment may be able to treat tumor areas even before they can be
detected by scanning technology. Overcoming this limitation would be a
huge and revolutionary step in the field of radiation oncology, and the
precision conferred by the CyberKnife could lead to its eventual
application in the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease and epilepsy, which
often involve lesioning specific areas of the brain.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of the CyberKnife has been a great
triumph for the fight against cancer. It caters to both the patient,
with its comfort and efficiency, and the scientist, with its precision
and extreme accuracy. Although this new weapon cannot promise to win
the war against cancer, it can definitely aid patients in the battle.<br />
