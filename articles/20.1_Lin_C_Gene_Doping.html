The advancement of technology brings not only benefits to society, but
also opportunities to misuse it. One issue that has come to the
public&#8217;s attention, specifically the sporting industry, is gene
therapy. While the 2012 Summer Olympics in London was one of the
cleanest in terms of banned substances, there is concern that any use
of doping was simply undetected. On the international level, athletic
competitions conduct regular, strict drug tests through either urine or
blood samples. However, these methods would not detect direct changes
in genes. Therefore, if athletes used gene therapy to alter their DNA
to enhance athletic performances, then anti-doping experts would not
detect any use of banned substances since no drug was technically used.
The potential of gene therapy, or more appropriately, gene doping, has
alarmed experts of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potentially using gene therapy as a new form of
doping was brought about by the research publications of Lee Sweeney at
the University of Pennsylvania. He showed that gene manipulation was
possible to genetically modify mice to increase muscles and produce
insulin-like growth factor, a natural stimulant, in muscles to improve
performance. The results were astounding. The mice&#8217;s muscle strength
increased by at least thirty percent and allowed them to run not only
faster, but also longer on treadmills, in comparison to unmodified
mice. However, the effects on the human body have still not been tested
or fully understood, so whether this technology can be considered as
doping is an entirely different case. Dr. Sweeny even stated that the
availability of this technology to humans is not for quite some time.
However, research in genetically modifying mice to enhance physical
abilities has continued to show promise. Two years after Dr. Sweeney&#8217;s
publication, in 2006, researchers at Dartmouth College modified a liver
gene to produce more AMPK, a substance boosting the concentrations of
glycogen, the natural store of chemical energy in mammals, to allow
genetically modified mice to not only run three times as long as that
of unmodified mice, but also suffer minimal exhaustion. Two years
later, in 2008, another group of researchers at University of
Pennsylvania were able to once again improve GM mice performance,
having them run six times further, by altering the interleukin-15R
alpha gene.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is much to learn about gene manipulation
before it can be fully controlled, WADA is on the alert. There is no
evidence that gene doping is currently being practiced, according to
Professor Steve Harridge, a muscle physiology expert at King&#8217;s College
London. However, as the technique becomes more refined, its illegal use
in competition will become more likely. As Andy Miah, sports ethicist
and director of Creative Futures Research Centre at the University of
the West of Scotland, describes, &#8220;There is no guarantee that gene
doping would work, but theoretically, is feasible, which piques the
interests of athletes and WADA, alike.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spirit of sports has always been to see who is
the best in a certain field through direct, fair competition; athletes
relying solely on their own skills to determine who is better. However,
using illegal and unfair methods to give oneself an edge tarnishes the
fairness that is supposedly present in sports. Furthermore, gene
therapy is meant for medicinal purposes, to treat patients whose
wellbeing is at stake. This technology is expensive and should be
prioritized for patients suffering from a genetic disorder, or any
disease. Gene therapy is a powerful tool that can cure numerous
currently incurable diseases, but non-medical related investors have
other plans for such a potent treatment.<br />
