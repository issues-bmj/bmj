<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; A study done recently in Taiwan by Dr.
Shiu-Dong Chung of National Taiwan University sought to see if there
was a correlation between erectile dysfunction and prior diagnosis of
open-angle glaucoma. Glaucoma was introduced around 400 BC, during the
time of Hippocrates, and originally described a swollen cornea or a
developing cataract due to increasing intraocular pressure. According
to Dr. Jerald Bell, an ophthalmologist, glaucoma is more commonly
understood to be damaging to the optic nerve caused by such elevated
intraocular pressure over an extended period of time; as a result,
glaucoma is a slow and progressive disorder that ultimately leads to
blindness, but only half of the people who may have glaucoma are truly
aware that they have the disease. Open-angle glaucoma is what the
majority of glaucoma patients suffer from, as aqueous fluid is
chronically unable to drain from the eye, whereas closed-angle glaucoma
is when the iris completely blocks fluid and leads to a build-up of
pressure. According to Dr. Nathan Congdon&#8217;s study published in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Journal of the American Medical Association</span>, glaucoma is the second
leading cause of blindness worldwide, and open-angle glaucoma is among
the most common cases. Possible cases of open-angle glaucoma are
correlated with older age, hypertension, and diabetes. The prevalence
of erectile dysfunction in men with such risk factors shows that
erectile dysfunction may be related to open-angle glaucoma, and the
Taiwanese study was interested in researching this link.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a population-based study, Dr. Chung and his
colleagues examined the association of erectile dysfunction with prior
open-angle glaucoma by sampling people in Taiwan over 40 years of age
who were recently diagnosed with erectile dysfunction. Patients with
prior open-angle glaucoma were compared to matched controls. Results
were further adjusted for a number of environmental variables, such as
economic class, geographic region and urbanization of the region, as
well as other health disorders such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes,
obesity, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. Results indicated
that people with prior open-angle glaucoma were 2.85 times more likely
to have erectile dysfunction, suggesting that there may be a related
mechanism of disease for the two disorders that has not yet been found.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this new research by the Taiwanese study, Dr.
Chung looks forward to implementing clinical guidelines for evaluating
patients with&nbsp; previously diagnosed erectile dysfunction as well
as furthering researching on the correlation between open-angle
glaucoma and erectile dysfunction in order to better prepare physicians
on advising patients with both conditions. With research, doctors can
recommend patients with the disorder to have their intraocular
pressures checked routinely, allowing for better and more efficient
diagnosis in patients with erectile dysfunction and open-angle
glaucoma. Doctors are also empowered to utilize such knowledge to
educate patients in fighting effectively against such an invasive
obstacle. With such exciting new therapies and treatments, doctors are
closer to bringing the fundamental concept of simple peace of mind and
freedom of life to patients that need it most.<br />
