<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from The Silent "Heartbeat"<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Frazier and Dr. Cohn have essentially been
the central two creators of this artificial heart since the
beginning&#8212;as they are the founders for the very technology they
synthesized together to make the unique device that is the pump-less
artificial heart. Their heart not only mimics an ordinary heart in
function, but it also exceeds the performance of traditional pulsing
pumps. Pulsing hearts cannot compensate for physical exertion such as
heavy exercise&#8212;but the pulse-less heart can.&nbsp; As TMC reports, Dr.
Cohn and Dr. Frazier&#8217;s heart can automatically adjust the blood flow to
correspond to a body&#8217;s needs, a serious problem that the traditional
pulsing devices cannot match. On top of that, their creation has been
rigorously tested and has not shown signs of wearing down to date.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pulsing of a heart is not necessary in a healthy
body either. Dr. Peterson clarifies by giving the example of bypass
surgery to demonstrate this fact. He explains that bypass surgery uses
a machine &#8220;much like Cohn and Frazier&#8217;s artificial heart.&#8221; During the
procedure, doctors would stop the heart and connect the superior and
inferior vena cava veins (large veins linked to the heart) to the input
section of a continuous flow pump machine while the output section
would be connected to the aorta (the largest artery in the body). The
machine would oxygenate the blood and sustain a patient throughout the
surgery. Dr. Peterson concludes that, &#8220;there is no reason for a pulse
pressure system for any organ in the body.&#8221; Dr. Cohn has similar
sentiments as he tells NPR, "The pulsatility of the flow is essential
for the heart, because it can only get nourishment in between
heartbeats [&#8230;] if you remove that from the system, none of the other
organs seem to care much."<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, without the presence of a heartbeat, the
main way to detect life has disappeared. Lacking a pulse, how would one
monitor the blood flow? This question was answered with the use of
Doppler ultrasound. Doppler ultrasound sends waves that bounce off of
the circulating blood and documents how fast the blood is flowing. Cohn
reports to TMC and explains that, "Instead of a typical 55-year-old&#8217;s
blood pressure of 120 over 80, Mr. Lewis has one number for blood
pressure &#8211; 90&#8230;It&#8217;s a flat line, and it doesn&#8217;t change." This means that
unlike a normal person, Lewis&#8217;s blood pressure would remain constant
while sleeping, exercising, and while going through emotional fluxes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why is this artificial heart not on the market
now? Thus far, the only human patient to receive this pulse-less heart
is Craig Lewis, a 55-year-old man who was dying of amyloidosis, a
condition where protein deposits can clog organs and shut them down.
His deteriorating condition made Lewis a prime candidate to undergo the
procedure. According to NPR, Lewis&#8217;s case was considered terminal,
prompting doctors to predict that he had only 12 hours to live. Urged
by his wife, Lewis opted to become the first human test subject for
doctors Cohn and Frazier&#8217;s heart (though it should be noted that at
least 38 calves were tested prior and are still alive and healthy
today). Lewis survived a month after the surgery with his new heart,
but died from complications due to his disease. NPR and Discover
Magazine both predict that in order to bring a continuous-flow
artificial heart to the market, the doctors will have to decide on a
final design, find a manufacturer, and get FDA approval.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cohn easily explains to TMC why this is a pertinent
experiment to today&#8217;s society: &#8220;Heart pumps help some, but for those
patients whose hearts are beyond repair, an off-the-shelf artificial
heart could be a godsend.&#8221; Also, because their artificial heart has a
continuous flow, the wear that is associated with a standard heart pump
is nonexistent. This means that it is not only a resource to meet the
demands for heart transplants, it is also safer overtime and would
require less money and surgery to maintain.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, some people may have misgivings
about a human having the ability to walk around without a heartbeat or
a pulse&#8212;mostly because it has never been done before. Yet skepticism is
a common hurdle to overcome in the science world. Cohn poetically
explains the comparable situation that occurred in the history of
flying machines.&nbsp; Scientists originally believed that the best way
to achieve flight was to mimic the flapping motion of wings typically
found in nature, yet "when they saw that you could create wind, and
that wind over a fixed wing was a great way to provide lift, then the
whole field shifted," Cohn says to NPR. "There are very few flying
machines in modern times that have flapping wings. And I think this is
the same intellectual leap in pumping blood or pumping fluids." The
pulse-less and completely artificial heart is the newest step in this
evolution of science that will allow humans to stay near the top of the
food chain. The exchange for this dominance would only be the sound of
a beating heart.<br />
