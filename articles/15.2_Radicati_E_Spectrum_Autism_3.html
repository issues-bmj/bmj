<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from The Spectrum of Autism<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; The third aspect of autism research focuses
solely on environmental effects. One study published in Environmental
Health Perspectives on July 2007 found a link between pregnant women
who lived in close proximity to pesticide-sprayed fields in the
California Central Valley and autism spectrum disorders in their
children. E.M. Roberts, MD, California Department of Health Services,
found an association between autism and the two most commonly used
pesticides, dicofol and endosulfan, during his research from 1996 to
1998.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Many pesticides in current use are neurological
toxins that may affect development via other mechanisms, and many,
including both scientists and the lay community, have voiced concern
that substances in the environment could contribute to autism,&#8221; Roberts
says of his interest in researching this topic.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roberts&#8217; research examined the pesticide-autism
connection through every combination of a few key factors: the types of
pesticides used, the mother&#8217;s physical distance from the site of
spraying, and her gestation period at the time of possible exposure.
The main pregnancy time periods examined were those linked to embryonic
central nervous system development and neural tube development &#8211; from
one to eight weeks. Through these preliminary examinations,
organochlorines like dicofol and endosulfan emerged as potential
linking factors between pesticide use and ASD.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this was the first project of its kind and its
results are preliminary, Roberts&#8217; findings are still debatable. The
importance of this research is not that it shows a definite causality
between pesticides and autism, but that it was one of the first studies
to use a variety of data sources, from social service to chemical use
records, to answer complex questions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, Roberts is quick to point out the variety of
the disease&#8217;s symptoms and possible causes. &#8220;Although our work provides
a possible clue, it in no way demonstrates that exposure to pesticides
during pregnancy causes autism,&#8221; Roberts says. &#8220;The study of
environmental factors in autism is just beginning.&#8221; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roberts already has ideas for the future direction
of autism research. &#8220;We would like to look closely at whether the
association between proximity to the organochlorine pesticides and
autism holds up over time,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Given the clue that specific
compounds such as endosulfan and dicofol could be related to autism, we
also hope that scientists in other fields could build on this finding
to understand more about how autism occurs and how it might be treated
and/or prevented.&#8221; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By understanding what causes autism, many scientists
and organizations believe they are closer to finding a solution. The
wide variety of recent research on genetic and environmental causes of
autism has provided the scientific community with interesting new
theories and directions for upcoming research, but most of these, like
the disorder itself, require more information.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s like the analogy of the blind men and the
elephant: autism is the elephant, with scientists looking at different
parts of it,&#8221; MacFabe says. Without being able to see the figurative
elephant that is autism as a whole, each &#8220;blind&#8221; scientist studying
individual factors have their own interpretation of what defines an
elephant. &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s right but everybody&#8217;s wrong. We need to bring
together experts in different aspects &#8211; that is going to be the new way
of researching autism.&#8221;</small><br />
