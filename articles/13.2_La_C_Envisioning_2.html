<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Another lens, the Viscian Implantable Collamer
Lens&#8482; (Viscian ICL) was cleared by the United States Food and Drug
Administration for widespread clinical use on December, 22, 2005.
Manufactured by Staar Surgical, the lens is capable of correcting for
visual de&#64257;cits that necessitate prescriptions ranging from -3.0
diopters to -20.0 diopters.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What accounts for the Viscian ICL&#8217;s improved
versatility over that of Verisye&#8482;? It consists of a co-polymer called
collamer that contains a small amount of puri&#64257;ed collagen, making the
lens highly biocompatible and therefore stable within the eye. Kawesch
explains that &#8220;the soft, &#64258;exible nature of the Visian ICL allows for
smaller surgical incisions and potentially reduced recovery times.&#8221;
During a<br />
20 minute procedure, the implant is placed behind the iris and in front
of the eye&#8217;s natural lens. &#8220;Typically, the small incision is
self-sealing and no stitches are required,&#8221; he says. A trial funded by
Staar Surgical, the results of which were published in the September
2004 issue of the Scienti&#64257;c Journal of Ophthalmology, examined 294
people ages 22 to 45 with an average pre-operative nearsightedness of
-10.06 diopters. After three years with an implantable collamer lens,
59 percent had 20/20 vision or better, while nearly 95 percent had at
least 20/40 vision.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do these phakic IOLs fare when compared directly
with LASIK in terms of vision improvement? Another study by Staar
Surgical compared the ICL to LASIK for correction between -8.0 diopters
and -12.0 diopters. A one-year post-operative study showed that 52
percent of ICL patients achieved 20/20 or better vision, compared to 36
percent for LASIK. According to Edward E. Manche, MD, Director of
Cornea and Refractive Surgery for Stanford Hospitals and Clinics, &#8220;the
quality of vision is likely to be better than LASIK because you&#8217;re not
changing the natural asphericity of the cornea, which some people
believe leads to some of the visual side-e&#64256;ects of corneal refractive
surgery.&#8221; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, with all surgical procedures come inherent
risks. According to the FDA, the number of possible complications
associated with phakic IOL includes an increased chance of retinal
detachment, corneal swelling, cataracts, or loss of endothelial cells
covering the cornea. Consequently, the FDA has required that lens
implants be used only for patients with su&#64259;cient endothelial cell
density to withstand such a loss.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reversibility of lens implants appears to be one
of the main advantages of phakic IOLs over permanent laser vision
correction techniques. &#8220;When you have a procedure as permanent as
LASIK, you don&#8217;t have a safety net. This procedure doesn&#8217;t have that
&#64257;nality,&#8221; says Manche. The lens implant can simply be removed if
complications arise or the correction loses e&#64256;ectiveness.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, phakic IOLs are not
&#64258;awless&#8212;corrective lens implants cost as much as laser vision
correction, if not more. The cost of the procedure is approximately
$3,500 per eye and is done one eye at a time, typically three to six
weeks apart. Additionally, like laser vision correction, implanted
lenses are generally not covered by insurance. Consequently, many
patients may opt for laser vision correction as a more economical
alternative.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, phakic IOLs do not constitute the &#64257;nal
solution to de&#64257;cits in vision. However, at the current breakneck pace
of technological advancement, it appears that the real challenge lies
in matching a patient&#8217;s expectations about various procedures with the
treatment that is most suited for his or her visual needs. It is always
important to remember that no procedure is &#8220;absolutely perfect for
every patient that walks through the door,&#8221; says Manche. But, at least
now, the future for the visually impaired has never been clearer.<br />
