Think of some of the most basic movements, emotions, or interactions in
your life &#8211; everything from telling your mother you love her to making
eye contact with someone during a conversation. Now imagine only being
able to perform these simple gestures with extreme difficulty and
practice, if at all. Unfortunately, for millions of those with autism,
this mysterious condition profoundly shapes their social development,
or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three recent research studies show that autism is
linked to both genetic and environmental factors. Although the authors
have concluded that more research is necessary to fully support their
results, the initial findings are still influential in showing that
autism is most likely not just a disorder with a single cause, but
rather, a group of disorders of varying and even multiple origins.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autism is one of a group of five disorders, known as
the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It primarily impairs communication
and social skills and affects approximately one in 150 children in the
United States, with four times as many males affected as females,
according to Autism Speaks, the world&#8217;s largest autism advocacy group.
Autism is mainly diagnosed in children through observation of impaired
social interactions and communication, repetitive behaviors such as
body rocking or self-injury, atypical eating patterns, and &#8220;splinter
skills,&#8221; which are uniquely specialized abilities such as quick mental
calculations or artistic talent.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since autism is a spectrum disorder, no single
behavior or symptom can be attributed to it. Although there is
currently no cure and no clear cause, autism research currently
receives less than five percent of the funding that less prevalent
childhood diseases receive, according to Autism Speaks. Now, however,
with increasing incidence and awareness of autism, more research is
emerging in the hopes of answering questions about the disorder. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One attempt to understand autism is the Autism
Genome Project (AGP), a study initiated by the National Alliance for
Autism Research and Autism Speaks. It is the largest study of its kind
to determine the genes associated with autism by pooling genetic
samples from more than 50 institutions in 19 countries. Beginning in
2004 by scanning the genomes of approximately 1,200 families with more
than one autistic child, the first phase was completed in February 2007.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andy Shih, PhD, of Autism Speaks, explains why
autism research needs this kind of sample size. &#8220;About a decade ago,
there were various geneticists working on autism research, but the
problem is that autism turned out to be a lot more complex than we
imagined,&#8221; Shih says. &#8220;There were numerous reports with small sample
sizes, very little consistency, and analysis was difficult. This was
around the time of the Human Genome Project, so the consensus of
leading geneticists was that they needed a very large, standardized
sample set.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AGP scanned the sample genomes looking for
variations that may be linked to autism, especially the copy number
variants (CNVs), or the number of copies of a particular gene in one&#8217;s
genome. Every person&#8217;s genome contains thousands of CNVs, most of which
are benign and contribute to individual differences such as height and
weight. However, the AGP scan revealed that many of the genetic
abnormalities of those with autism occurred only in particular genes.
According to Shih, many of the genes found were affiliated with
synaptic junctions, specifically those regulating excitatory or
inhibitory responses. This is consistent with many common behavioral
traits characteristic of autism such as repetitive speech or extreme
sensitivity to noise or touch.<br />
