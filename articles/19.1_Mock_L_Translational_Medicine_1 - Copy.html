<h3 style="text-align: center;">An Engineer&#8217;s Re-Interpretation of
Medicine: Translational Medicine<br />
</h3>
<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">Lauren Mock<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">December 2011<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="" src="19.1_Mock_L_Translational_Medicine.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2005, Steve Jobs
authorized his engineers to commence work on a
revolutionary product that integrated multiple complex technologies.
Less than two years later, Jobs announced and delivered his innovative
product, the now ubiquitous iPhone to his customers. At a similarly
rapid pace, Andy Grove, as President or CEO of Intel Corporation,
launched complex computer microprocessors with drastically improved
chip architectures in quick succession every few years. In contrast to
the mercurial speed of high tech innovation , John Castellani,
President of&nbsp; the PhRMA pharmaceutical trade association reported
in his organization&#8217;s Catalyst blog, &#8220;Biopharmaceutical research is a
painstaking field, one in which an average new medicine can take 10 to
15 years to be developed and brought to patients.&#8221; <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reduce time-to-market and improve the
yields from medical research,
an emerging field of medicine known as translational medicine seeks to
apply engineering principles and high-tech product development
processes to medical innovation. Reducing time and improving yields are
critical. Once afflicted by prostate cancer and now Parkinson&#8217;s
disease, Andy Grove, like many patients suffering from long-term
illnesses, was frustrated waiting decades for new treatments. Grove
sums, &#8220;What we have learned from decades of rapid development of
information technology is that the key is relentless focus on &#8216;better,
faster, cheaper&#8217; &#8212; in everything &#8230; The best results are achieved
through the cooperative efforts of different disciplines, all aimed at
the same objective.&#8221; <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implementing translational medicine aims
to improve and accelerate the
entire process of converting basic scientific discovery and
leading-edge medical research into advances in practical patient
care.&nbsp; It is an interdisciplinary approach to medical innovation
that requires procedural awareness and optimizing processes from &#8220;bench
to bedside.&#8221; Participants from scientists, clinical researchers,
practicing doctors, to pharmaceutical professionals or medical
equipment suppliers, and most of all, patients have a critical stake in
translational medicine. The benefits of this new paradigm can improve
quality of life or ultimately save the lives of patients. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To engineers, implementing many aspects of
translational medicine
appears to be nothing more than standard practice. For instance,
creating an environment that promotes communication between
interdisciplinary stakeholders in medical innovation is critical to
translational medicine. In an interview for the <span style="font-style: italic;">Next Generation
Pharmaceutical</span> trade periodical, Francesco Marincola, Chief of
the
Infectious Disease and Immunogenetics at the National Institute of
Health (NIH) posits, &#8220;The most difficult problem when trying to test
ideas efficiently is the communication between the basic scientists and
the clinicians.&#8221; Yet, fostering communications, for example, by
creating an environment of collocated teams, either physically or
virtually, to collaborate and streamline information interchange is a
frequently used strategy in high-tech product development.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also common in technology delivery
processes is the use of rapid
project feedback and mandatory post-project reviews to analyze root
causes of failure and inefficiencies. These project assessments provide
a wealth of learning that improves product delivery and prevents
repetition of failures. However, medical practice often lacks similar
discipline. For example, glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
provided great promise for treating Parkinson&#8217;s disease, yet Amgen
Corporation, in a contentious decision, halted its Phase II GDNF trial
in 2004 over its concerns about safety and lack of efficacy. Numerous
stakeholders including researchers and patients like Andy Grove were
left deeply frustrated by the reluctance of research sponsors to review
results that fell short of clinical implementation but could provide an
opportunity to capitalize upon failure with new learning.</small> <br />
