<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, altruism has been proven time and
time again to effectively promote good health whilst selfishness
confers detrimental consequences. Negative neural signals, resulting
from selfish behavior, cause psychological stress, &#8220;which is associated
with lower telomerase activity, and shorter telomere length, all of
which are known determinants of cell senescence and longevity, &#8221;
according to Elissa Epel, PhD, University of California, San Francisco.
The length of telomeres, repeating segments flanking the ends of DNA,
decreases with each DNA replication and thus leads to aging. Simply
put, psychological stress contributes to biological aging, which can
lead to the premature onset of many diseases. Altruistic behavior, on
the other hand, prevents negative stress, &#8220;which may contribute to good
health and longevity by preventing the acceleration of aging at the
cellular level,&#8221; says Stephen Post, PhD, Case Western Reserve
University. Likewise, Doug Oman, PhD, University of California,
Berkeley, reaffirms this point in one of his studies, in which high
volunteerism actually decreased the mortality rate of the senior
population.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his 2005 International Journal of Behavioral
Medicine paper, Post states, &#8220;The consequences of negative emotional
responses are increased susceptibility to disease and worse health
outcomes. It has been shown that unforgiving thoughts can prompt more
aversive emotion and significantly higher heart rate and blood pressure
changes from the baseline.&#8221; The opposite effect is supported by
findings in a 1999 experiment conducted by Carolyn Schwartz, ScD,
Harvard Medical School, and Rabbi Meir Sendor, PhD, Brandeis
University, in which voluntary peer supporters trained in
client-centered psychotherapy were given the task of contacting and
giving support to multiple sclerosis patients. The supporter&#8217;s job was
to record and listen compassionately, but never to give advice. Over a
period of two years, these volunteer supporters described &#8220;a sense of
inner peace that allowed them to listen to others without judgment or
interference...and a greater benefit in quality of life outcomes than
those they helped... and consequently developed more confidence and
gratification from the role,&#8221; Schwartz said.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is still not enough motivation to do good
deeds and think of others compassionately, studies on undergraduates
show the positive effects of altruism. In 2006, a team of researchers
led by Kristin Neff, PhD, University of Texas at Austin conducted an
experiment with 177 undergraduate students. &#8220;The study found that
compassion had a significant positive association with self-reported
measures of happiness, optimism, personal initiative, extroversion, and
conscientiousness.&#8221; A similar 1995 study by Sara Little, PhD,
University of Rhode Island, tested 470 undergraduates from four major
New England universities, where altruistic volunteers reported &#8220;higher
levels of empathetic concern, personal responsibility, and practical
moral reasoning than did no volunteers.&#8221; These are all indicators of a
healthy lifestyle in college students, and these good deeds no doubt
trigger positive feelings that reinforce Epel and Post&#8217;s earlier
statements.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently, it pays to do good. After years of
evolution, it is clear that altruistic behavior benefits not only the
recipient but also the benefactor. Performing altruistic acts has
resulted in elevated levels of happiness, positive feelings of
self-worth, increased cellular longevity &#8211; all important indicators of
good health. So next time, do take the time to help your friend with
that assignment, or get out and volunteer more. Put your skills to work
for the benefit of others because, ultimately, doing good is good for
you.</small><br />
