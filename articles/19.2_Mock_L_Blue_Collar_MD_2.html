<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; For doctors who can transition from practicing
as independent business-owners to practicing as salaried workers,
institutional employment does offer an attractive option with many
benefits. As part of a healthcare system, doctors receive a
competitive, stable salary and may often receive performance bonuses
based, for example, on how many patients the doctor treats.&nbsp; The
hospital administration handles the drudgery of administrative services
for the practice &#8212; billing, claims processing, payment negotiation with
insurers, staff and retirement benefits management, and operation of
the electronic health records system. Consequently, doctors can focus
specifically on patients and the practice of medicine. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, despite the promise of better care at lower
prices, the benefits are debatable for the patient. Many patients,
especially those who seldom need a doctor, may not notice much of a
difference. Logistically, many patients still see the same doctor, and
now receive the added benefits of coordinated care as patient records
seamlessly transfer between specialists and patients conveniently
complete lab tests in the same or nearby site.&nbsp; However, many
still fear that corporatized medicine with regional monopolies and
business inflexibilities may subject patients to longer waiting lines
for care from over-scheduled doctors unreachable after 9 to 5. The
attentive, intimate patient-doctor relationship of the past may be
replaced by assembly-line medicine from unfamiliar, blue-collar
doctors. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a larger scale, healthcare policy experts like
Paul Ginsburg, President of the non-partisan Center for Studying Health
System Change, warns that insurers, patients and employers may face
higher prices. In testimony on September 2011 before the U.S. House of
Representatives Ways and Means Committee, Subcommittee on Health,
Ginsburg stated, &#8220;. . . insurers consistently cited higher payment
rates to obtain hospital and large physician group participation in
health plan networks as a major factor driving higher insurance
premiums.&#8221; Hospital systems with large groups of doctors can exert
greater monopolistic market power on private insurers than doctors
working in small private practices. This power can ultimately drive up
private insurance prices paid by employers and consumers. Profit
motives at large hospitals may give salaried doctors less flexibility
in ordering procedures under fixed insurance reimbursements.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse, in the reality of hard economics, healthcare
may become less available as many physicians simply opt-out. In 2010,
the Physicians Foundation Health Reform and the Decline of Physician
Private Practice reported that about three quarters of physicians it
surveyed plan to change their practices in the next one to three years,
and that most of the changes will have the effect of reducing or
eliminating patient access to care, including reducing work hours,
closing the practice to new patients, reducing the number of patients
seen, seeking alternative employment outside healthcare, or simply
retiring. On the other hand, by accepting established doctors in the
midst of career transition and by hiring many new doctors, health care
systems may actually promote the availability of doctors by giving
physicians the opportunity to start or remain in practice when their
independent businesses become economically infeasible.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The private practice provides physicians great
autonomy in controlling their careers and the direction of their
practices.&nbsp; The nursing and administrative staff of private
practices works for doctors, and the physicians retain influence over
their employees who work with them in scheduling their day, delivering
care, and managing the total patient experience. However, market
consolidation driven by national health policies promotes economics
that work against private practice. The inability to compete against
healthcare giants for lower costs or talent of newly minted doctors in
the labor market will demand a huge risk premium that the physician
must pay for autonomy and control. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin Pho, M.D., a specialist in internal medicine
summarizes in his healthcare industry blog, "Large conglomerates of
employed physicians will soon become the dominant model of care in the
United States. This change is not only coming from the top down, but
from the bottom up as well." Still, opportunities remain for
entrepreneurial physicians who seek the freedom of their own business.
Larger practices remain that can afford professional management and
investments to keep pace with information and medical technologies.
Single or multispecialty practices may offer a diversified suite of
services to create multiple revenue streams, some not requiring the
constant attention of the physician.&nbsp; Newer physician practice
models may continue to offer the independent physician financially
viable alternatives, such as part-time, locum tenens (temporary), and
concierge type boutique practices where the doctor contracts directly
with the patient on a monthly fee basis.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With economic, political and social changes, the
future of medicine for doctors and their patients remain uncertain.
However, one thing that does remain certain is change and the
resilience of doctors and patients to adapt to new models of care.</small><br />
