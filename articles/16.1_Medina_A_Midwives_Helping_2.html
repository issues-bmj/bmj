<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When differences in prenatal education and
psychosocial care were examined, Oakley notes that 98 percent of women
in the CNM group, compared to 81 percent of women in the physician
group, received nutritional education. Moreover, 92 percent of the CNM
patients, compared to 71 percent of the physician patients, received
specific suggestions regarding their prenatal diet. Oakley also cites
that 75 percent of the women in the CNM cohort, as opposed to 57
percent of the women in the physician cohort, reported that sexual
intercourse during pregnancy had been discussed. This illustrates the
level of intimacy CNMs have with their patients, as 97 percent in the
CNM group stated that this discussion had been with their primary care
provider, as opposed to 69 percent in the physician group.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 1998 news release by the National Center for
Health Statistics states that &#8220;CNMs generally spend more time with
their patients during prenatal visits and put more emphasis on patient
counseling and education and providing emotional support. Most CNMs are
with their patients on a one-on-one basis during the entire labor and
delivery process providing patient care and emotional support, in
contrast with physician&#8217;s care which is often more episodic.&#8221; Cragin
echoes this sentiment by explaining that &#8220;midwifery is about creating
relationships with patients as well as collaborating with them to
create a shared view of birth.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When neonatal outcomes were examined, further
differences between the care-provider groups were revealed. In a 1998
study published in the Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health,
Marian MacDorman, PhD, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Division of Vital Statistics, observed that the infant mortality rate
in singleton vaginal deliveries at 35 to 43 weeks of gestation was 13.9
percent lower for births delivered by the CNM group. Additionally,
MacDorman cites that the percentage of low birth weight and pre-term
births was higher in the physician group, although this statistic may
be influenced by CNMs&#8217; obligation to hand high-risk cases over to
physicians. In contrast, Oakley&#8217;s study highlights excellent neonatal
outcomes in both groups. While respiratory difficulties did not exist
in either of the two provider groups, she points to meaningful
differences in infant mortality and significant differences in the
following indicators of health: gestational age, infant length, and
head circumference and contusions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oakley also notes that a significantly higher number
of the neonates in the CNM group, 91.7 percent compared to 82.2
percent, were breastfed immediately after delivery. Furthermore,
neonates in the physician group were less likely to remain with their
mothers throughout their hospital stay, which illustrates the CNM
emphasis on the importance of mother-infant bonding.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the November 2006 issue of the Journal of
Obstetric, Gynecological, and Neonatal Nursing, Cragin concludes that
&#8220;even among moderate-risk patients, the midwifery model of care with
its limited use of interventions can produce outcomes equivalent to or
better than those of the biomedical model.&#8221;&#8221; Therefore, since the two
provider groups have similar safety and efficacy results, patients need
to consider their preferred philosophical approach to the birthing
process before selecting a provider.</small><br />
