Have you ever wished for that irresistible chemical attraction between
you and a member of the opposite sex? Today, science has delivered the
answer&#8212;a potion in the form of human pheromones. Historically, there
has been much debate over the existence and function of human
pheromones. The difficulty in identifying such pheromones is summed up
by Harvard University&#8217;s Catherine Dulac, Ph.D., Professor of Molecular
and Cellular Biology and Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute. According to Dr. Dulac, &#8220;It has been difficult to identify
human pheromones that elicit innate behavioral arrays since behavior in
humans is far more likely to be tempered by learning and experience.&#8221; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pheromones are chemical substances released by one
individual and received by a second individual of the same species,
triggering sexual attraction when detected by members of the opposite
sex. In order to participate in pheromone-induced behavior, humans must
have a sensory organ in addition to the olfactory epithelium to aid in
the detection of airborne chemicals. A great deal of evidence points to
the vomeronasal organ as this pheromone sensor.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vomeronasal organs (VNOs) are found in many
mammalian species, including humans. Located in the vomer bone between
the nose and the mouth, the VNO is used concurrently with the olfactory
epithelium as an airborne chemical detector and pheromone receptor. The
VNOs of hamsters are surrounded by muscular tissues, which pump odors
onto the receptor cells. Horses, dogs, cats, and other species have
been known to draw odors into their mouths and through the nasal palate
to facilitate placement of pheromones on the vomeronasal organ upon
encountering a member of the opposite sex in a process known as flehmen.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, occurrences of VNO degeneration in
late fetal development have prompted scientists to postulate that the
human VNO was a vestigial organ&#8212;a degenerate, usually nonfunctioning,
structure that was fully developed or functioning in a preceding
generation or at an earlier stage of development. However, recent s t u
d i e s have shown that at least 90 percent of adults have a visible
VNO on their nasal septum. These human VNOs are a pair of tiny tubes
that are only millimeters long. Closer inspection of the human VNO
reveals an epithelium consistent with the hypothesis of the VNO as a
chemical sensory organ. Further analysis also reveals cells similar to
sensory neurons. However, there is as of yet no conclusive proof that
neural connections exist between the VNO sensory nerves and the brain.
Nonetheless, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that the
VNO does not degenerate and remains functional throughout a person&#8217;s
life.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The debate concerning the purpose of human
pheromones may finally come to a conclusive end with the recent
discovery and successful synthesis of a female human pheromone. The
Athena Institute for Women&#8217;s Wellness Research has isolated and
synthesized Athena Pheromone 10:13&#8482;, purified from the scent released
by young women as a subconscious sex attractant. According to Winnifred
Cutler, Ph.D., founder of the Athena Institute, the pheromone&#8217;s
discoverer, &#8220;Athena Pheromone 10:13&#8482; can enhance the &#8216;sexual
attractiveness&#8217; of women&#8221; and has passed &#8220;science&#8217;s &#8216;gold standard&#8217;
test of whether a product works&#8212;a double-blind, placebo-controlled
study.&#8221; Studies in 2002 reported that heterosexual women wearing Athena
10:13&#8482; engaged in increased sexual activity with men. In a more recent
study published in 2004, Joan Friebely, Ed.D., of Harvard University,
and psychiatrist Susan Rako, M.D., showed that the synthesized human
pheromone discovered by the Athena Institute increased the frequency of
intimate sexual behavior with partners in post-menopausal women who no
longer produced the pheromone naturally.<br />
