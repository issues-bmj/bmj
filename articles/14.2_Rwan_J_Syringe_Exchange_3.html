<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Syringe Exchange Programs</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph Guydish, PhD, MPH, professor at the
University of California, San Francisco and associate director of the
California-Arizona node of the National Institute of Drug Abuse
Clinical Trials Network explains, &#8220;One reason for lack of federal
support is our national approach to drug abuse and addiction, which I
believe is more driven by punitive, legalistic, and criminal approaches
than in other countries. In the context of a federal war on drugs, I
believe there is a troublesome symbolism to federal distribution or
exchange of clean syringes. So the matter is not so simple as federal
funding for syringe exchange, but may require retooling decades of drug
policy to frame a national drug policy approach in which funding of
SEPs can exist in the policy environment.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, within each state, some community
members oppose SEP on the same moral basis from which they oppose drug
use as an illegal and immoral activity. Popular opinion data indicates
that at least half of American adults are in support of SEP, according
to Robert MacCoun, PhD, professor of Law and Public Policy at the
University of California, Berkeley and author of the 2001 book Drug War
Heresies: Learning from Other Vices, Times, and Places. MacCoun warns,
however, that &#8220;those who are opposed are far more passionate about
their opposition. Supporters are more likely to display what Mark
Kleiman [PhD, Director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at the
University of California, Los Angeles] calls &#8216;grudging tolerance.&#8217; They
aren&#8217;t enthusiastic about needled exchange; they just recognize it
might be necessary.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, new evidence suggests that SEP may
actually encourage, rather than prevent, drug injection behavior in
unsafe locations. In a 2006 Substance Use &amp; Misuse article, Kate
Ksobiech, PhD, of Marquette University, notes that clean needles alone
do not appear to be sufficient motivation to change high-risk
behaviors. In fact, Ksobiech finds that SEP participants are more
likely to engage in risky behaviors such as injecting drugs at shooting
galleries than non-participants. Although the slight increase in risky
injection behavior was the only negative outcome in an analysis of five
categories of effectiveness, this finding can be taken as support for
the federal stance of refusing to fund SEP.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of federal funding has dampened the reach
and effectiveness of SEP in injection drug user communities. Even with
state and local support, many programs cannot meet the demand for
supplies, affecting their reliability in the community as supplies run
short due to lack of funding. Matthew LeComte, a needle exchange
volunteer in San Francisco, worries about the detrimental public health
consequences if the shortage of supplies continues. &#8220;If you flood the
community with free, clean needles, then injection drug users will use
them unsparingly. However, if the supply of syringes is low due to lack
of funding, then users will reuse and share needles, effectively
returning to the pre-SEP days of high-risk behaviors.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From lowered transmission rates of HIV and hepatitis
C virus to cessation of injecting drugs, most research indicates that
SEPs are an effective means to reducing harmful behaviors in injection
drug users. Nonetheless, these programs cannot mollify the
unquantifiable fears of crime and moral degeneration that are invoked
by the idea of injection drug use. This fear, combined with lack of
federal funding, has proven to be a significant barrier to widespread
adoption of syringe exchanges. The future of these programs lies in the
ability of the proponents and detractors alike to balance the public
health benefits with the broader moral implications of continued
illegal drug use.</small><br />
