<p style="text-align: center;">Improving vision with phakic intraocular lenses</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Connie La<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">Spring 2006<br />
</p>

<p><small><br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="phakic intraocular lens lasik keratomileusis laser iols" src="13.2_La_C_Envisioning.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is the most irksome part about wearing contact lenses? Scouring
the bathroom &#64258;oor on your hands and knees, searching for an
indiscernible lens? Waking up from a nap to &#64257;nd a contact lens stuck to
the inside of your eyelid? How about the monotonous hygienic routine?
When we think of improving vision without the hassle of glasses or
contact lenses, one procedure often comes to mind: Laser-assisted
In-situ Keratomileusis, or LASIK. However, for many people&#8212;especially
those with extremely high-power prescriptions, dry eyes, or thin
corneas&#8212;surgically implanted phakic intraocular lenses (IOLs) may be a
better alternative.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, it is estimated that several million
people nationwide are ineligible for LASIK; nonetheless, they may be
potential candidates for IOL implants. Although both procedures a&#64256;ect
the structures of the eye that focus incident light, each does so in
its own fashion. LASIK uses a laser to reshape the surface of the
cornea, whereas IOLs function as adjuncts to the natural lens, which
modi&#64257;es focusing power.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phakic IOLs are analogous to the intraocular
lenses that have been used in cataract surgeries for over half a
century. Initially, the IOLs that cataract patients received were &#64257;xed
focal lenses that were designed to replace the natural crystalline lens
of the eye and could only compensate for de&#64257;cits in distance vision;
consequently, the patients still had to wear eyeglasses to correct
problems in intermediate and close-up vision. Phakic IOLs, however,
allow the lens to move with the muscles of the eye and focus on objects
at all distances, and, moreover, can be placed inside the eye without
removing the natural lens. This technology is now no longer limited to
cataract patients alone, as more surgeons are exploring the use of IOLs
for people who need correction for their myopia (nearsightedness),
hyperopia (farsightedness), or presbyopia (farsightedness with
advancing age).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One type of phakic IOL, patented as the Verisyse&#8482;
lens, is marketed in North America by Advanced Medical Optics and
elsewhere under the trade-name ARTISAN® by Ophtec Holding BV. The
Verisyse&#8482; lens is an option for those seeking correction of common
vision errors such as moderate to severe myopia, characterized by
prescriptions ranging from -5.0 to -20.0 diopters. This is well beyond
the range of LASIK, which is only approved for the treatment of
patients with prescriptions of -14.0 diopters or less. In truth, many
surgeons do not proceed with LASIK under myopic conditions above -8.00
diopters.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Composed of a plastic known as
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), the Verisyse&#8482; phakic IOL is inserted
behind the cornea and on top of the iris. According to Gary Kawesch,
OD, of the Laser Eye Center of Silicon Valley, &#8220;the implantation of a
phakic IOL is done as an outpatient procedure in an ambulatory surgery
center, under local or topical anesthesia. Most patients experience
little to no discomfort during the actual procedure, which takes
approximately thirty to sixty minutes.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do ophthalmologists and optometrists quantify
visual acuity? Focusing ability is measured against 20/20 vision; for
example, an individual with 20/40 needs to be 20 feet away from a given
object in order to discern it clearly, whereas an individual with 20/20
vision could accomplish this from a distance of 40 feet. Having 20/20
vision is considered normal, while having 20/40 vision is the cuto&#64256; for
driving a car without wearing corrective lenses. In a clinical study
conducted by Ophtec USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Ophtec Holding BV, about
92 percent of 662 myopic patients who received a Verisyse&#8482; phakic
intraocular lens implant achieved 20/40 vision or better, while 44
percent achieved 20/20 vision or better. According to the October 2005
issue of Ophthalmology Times, another clinical study by Ophtec USA,
Inc. involving a one-year follow-up of 102 patients that underwent the
same procedure revealed that 47 percent of the patients gained 20/20
vision or better, while 93.6 percent gained 20/40 vision or better.<br />
