&#8220;I&#8217;m on birth control,&#8221; may soon be something that not only women can
say, thanks to promising new research on male hormonal contraception
(MHC). While this hormone therapy is not reliable enough to market just
yet, it does raise the possibility of a future line of hormone
contraceptives designed especially for men.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many other biological mechanisms in the body,
spermatogenesis is regulated by a negative feedback loop, meaning that
the more sperm there is available in the testes, the slower sperm
production occurs. The process begins when hormones made in the brain
trigger the production of the hormones in testicular cells, and these
testicular hormones then help to produce sperm. One of these hormones,
testosterone, not only participates in spermatogenesis but also signals
the brain to stop producing the messenger hormones. Therefore, when
testosterone levels rise, spermatogenesis ceases to occur. Male
hormonal contraception involves large dose injections of testosterone,
which prevent messenger hormones from signaling testicular cells to
produce the other hormones necessary for spermatogenesis. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers from Schering, a pharmaceutical company
in the Netherlands, published a study in the April 2007 issue of the
Endocrine Society Journal about the effectiveness of MHC in preventing
sperm production. While the research team is not the first to look into
male hormonal contraception, their study is the largest to date and is
also the first to be a double-blinded, controlled study, meaning that
neither the researcher nor the participants know which participants
have received the treatment. These methodological improvements make it
&#8220;a stepping stone to product development and registration,&#8221; according
to Peter Liu, PhD, an andrologist at the University of Sydney, in an
editorial in the May 2008 issue of the Journal of Clinical
Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism responding to the Schering team&#8217;s
findings. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 44 weeks, 354 men received either an injection
of testosterone or a placebo injection every ten weeks. Ninety percent
of men who received a testosterone injection stopped producing sperm
for the entire study, while three percent saw no decrease in
spermatogenesis. The other seven percent of men temporarily stopped
producing sperm but began again before the study was over.<br />
The results intrigued researchers. Why do some men continue to produce
sperm even without signals from the brain, while others, more
surprisingly, experience a rebound effect? Liu speculates that some men
are capable of producing the hormones necessary for spermatogenesis
without receiving a signal from the brain.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because ten percent is still considered a high
failure rate for a birth control device, MHC is not yet ready to be
available in the market. Nevertheless, the Schering study is important
in establishing the potential for such a contraceptive device. Liu
published a study in the May 2008 issue of Endocrine Care showing that
testosterone injections are more reliable in conjunction with
injections of progestin, a hormone closely related to testosterone.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if this combination injection proves reliable,
male hormonal contraceptives will still face marketing obstacles.
Pharmaceutical companies question the profitability of MHC on two
fronts. First, they wonder whether men will want to buy a product that
promises infertility. Second, pharmaceutical companies worry that women
will refuse to rely on a pregnancy prevention method that requires
complete trust in the man, and that this distrust will discourage men
from purchasing the product. Although valid, the pharmaceutical
companies&#8217; concerns run contrary to results from marketing research.
Schering&#8217;s 2005 global survey found that 55 percent of men would be
interested in a &#8220;new male fertility control.&#8221; Despite this positive
response, Schering stopped funding MHC research in 2006.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers lament the reluctance of drug companies
to give this birth control device a chance. Nonetheless, they hope that
as they fine-tune the dosages and combinations of hormone injections,
drug companies and the general public will be more receptive to the
idea of male hormonal contraceptives as a reliable form of birth
control, if not just something that can be used to complement the
existing female contraceptive.<br />
