<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="music senior citizen neural timing" src="19.2_Zhao_E_Old_Tune.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some welcome change with open arms, but for senior citizens going
through their golden years, change can prove to be a fearsome and
traumatizing opponent. As their body slowly deteriorates, they are
being thrown into an environment never seen before. As these
conservative seniors grow older, they look to family, close friends,
and doctors to try to regain the vitality of their youth. In January,
neuroscientist Alexandra Parbery-Clark and her colleagues at
Northwestern University published an article in the journal <span style="font-style: italic;">Neurobiology of Aging</span>
that claims to have discovered biological evidence that musical
experience can help a senior citizen fight the deterioration of neural
timing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous research by neuroscientist Nina Kruas published in the journal <span style="font-style: italic;">Nature Reviews Neuroscience</span>
shows that just as physical exercise improves fitness of the body,
musical training improves the brain&#8217;s auditory fitness. This auditory
fitness is essential for speech perception and social interaction in
daily life. In Parbery-Clark&#8217;s study, the Northwestern neuroscientists
monitored a pool of young (mean age of 23 years old) and old (mean age
of 56 years old) musicians and non-musicians with standard hearing
abilities, and examined their subcortical responses to different
frequencies and syllables. The study tracked neural timing by
identifying peaks in subcortical response generated by synchronous
neural firing. Results indicated that the older non-musician test
subjects were less responsive to noise bursts compared to younger
non-musicians, but this distinction was absent in the musician sample
pool. With the data, the Northwestern study concluded that the
deterioration of inhibitory receptors in the auditory system due to
aging is one of the potential candidates for this response timing since
inhibitory processes are known to be responsible for the neural
response patterns to speech.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These findings are significant to the general
population because the vigor of youth is cherished as an important
aspect of a senior citizen going through aging. With exposure to music,
seniors may be encouraged to delay the effects of aging by spending
time interacting with music. As musical abilities clearly protect
against the aging of neural timing, further research may elucidate
other aspects of aging that can be gently delayed through the
environment. Parbery-Clark and her colleagues encourage further
research into how music may interact with other parts of the brain in
order to promote &#8220;neural resilience across the lifespan&#8221; and give the
general population the ability to enjoy life to the fullest.<br />
