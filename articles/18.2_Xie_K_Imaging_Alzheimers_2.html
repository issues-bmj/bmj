<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Imaging Alzheimer's</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; PiB was developed by a team of researchers at
the University of Pittsburgh led by geriatric psychiatrist William
Klunk, M.D., Ph.D., and radiologist Chester Mathis, Ph.D.&nbsp; The
twelve-year endeavor started in 1988 when Dr. Klunk read about a study
that attempted to use a dye called Congo Red as a treatment to keep
amyloid from clumping.&nbsp; &#8220;I thought that it was sort of a long
shot, but I figured if we could just get the dye into the brain, we
could at least image it and see where it was,&#8221; said Klunk.&nbsp; The
first form of PiB used a radioactive carbon (C11) compound.&nbsp; While
it has already been highly useful for research purposes, the short
twenty-minute half-life of the C11 makes it impractical for clinical
use.&nbsp; The Pittsburgh lab quickly went to work making a more
practical version for diagnostic use.&nbsp; PiB-F18, an amyloid tracer
that uses a fluorine isotope with a half-life of ninety minutes, is in
its third stage of clinical testing and should soon be approved for
general use in hospitals.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autopsies of patients who have died of AD
show extensive buildup of amyloid plaques on the surface of the brain,
as well as massive disintegration of brain tissue.&nbsp; While there
are speculations on the causes of the disease, there are still no
definitive answers for what role these protein plaques play or how the
neurological degeneration occurs.&nbsp; There have been theoretical
correlations between AD and head traumas, cerebrovascular disease, and
some genetic disorders such as Down&#8217;s syndrome.&nbsp; These patterns
are a start, but are not particularly concrete.&nbsp; Trying to find a
cure for AD has been like trying to solve a puzzle in the dark.&nbsp;
Hopefully, studies using PiB will be able to illuminate the cause of
this disease and bring researchers one step closer to finding a cure.
&nbsp;<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a neurodegenerative disorder takes
hold, there is almost nothing that can be done.&nbsp; Parts of the
brain are literally lost as the tissue begins to degenerate.&nbsp; Even
if the process were somehow halted, lost functionality would not be
recoverable.&nbsp; Because of this, treatments for AD and other such
neurological diseases tend to aim for the early stages of the disease.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are currently four FDA-approved
drugs used in the treatment of AD, none of which have any effect on
delaying the actual progression of the disease.&nbsp; They are
typically cholinesterase inhibitors, and they work to prevent the
breakdown of essential signaling chemicals in the brain so that
patients can experience better memory and more cognitive awareness.
However, these drugs are minimally effective at best and become less
effective as the disease progresses.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the main body of hope for a true AD
cure lies in the production of an amyloid antibody, proteins that bind
to the &#946;-amyloid plaques and tell the body&#8217;s own immune system to
destroy them.&nbsp; Using this strategy, the neurons remain unharmed,
but the plaques are very specifically targeted and cleared away.&nbsp;
Currently the issue is that none of the handful of drugs that had been
tested in the past 50 years have shown any signs of working; one even
made patients worse.&nbsp; However, in the past decade or so, the
research for AD has made significant progress.&nbsp; <br />
