The United States of America is known to be a &#8220;melting pot.&#8221;
Approximately 12% of the population is foreign born, thus making recent
findings of a correlation between the onset of psychosis and age of
immigration strikingly important. And in the face of growing
international economies, these findings are also significant for those
considering emigrating.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psychotic disorders are defined as illnesses such as
schizophrenia, where the distinction between real and unreal becomes
blurred and emotional and social situations become difficult, bipolar
disorder, where one varies between mania and depression, or delusional
disorder, where one experiences delusions that are not completely
impossible and does not suffer from any emotional disorder or have
hallucinations. In December 2011, Dr. Wim Veling, Dr. Hans Hoek, Dr.
Jean-Paul Selton, and Dr. Ezra Susser of the Parnassia Psychiatric
Institute in the Netherlands published their findings of the
relationship between immigrant age and psychosis in The Hague, the
capital of South Holland, Netherlands. A previous study of the UK and
the Netherlands showed that Africa Caribbean immigrants in the UK have
four times the risk of developing a psychotic disorder and that there
is an elevated risk for Moroccan, Surinamese, and Antillean migrants in
the Netherlands. This study aimed to relate the age of migration with
the risk of developing a psychotic disorder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their study spanned seven years and focused on
migrants between the ages of 15 to 54 who had made contact with a
physician for the first time regarding psychosis. Those who showed
symptoms before migration were not considered, and the patients were
natives of four countries: Surinam, Netherland Antilles, Turkey, and
Morocco.&nbsp; After developing a detailed medical history of each
patient illustrating the illness&#8217;s progression, the researches obtained
migration age data from municipal authorities and used a statistical
analysis program and a chi-square test. They found that a younger age
at time of migration is associated with a higher risk of psychosis with
those who immigrated at ages 0 to 4 being the most at risk.
Additionally, risk was highest in those who did not move by their own
choice. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of age on the probability of developing
psychosis may be due to the length of the risk period immigrants have.
An individual&#8217;s risk period is from birth until the late teens, during
which particular events and experiences can increase the individual&#8217;s
susceptibility to psychotic disorders. In opposition to previous
theories of being genetically predisposed for psychosis, Veling et al.
found that parents of Moroccan patients did not have a higher risk than
those of Dutch patients, supporting the findings found previously with
African Caribbean parents and patients in the UK. Another theory is
that perhaps these individuals migrate because children are showing
symptoms of psychosis. However, Veling et al. argue that it is unlikely
for a parent of a child five years old or younger will see these
symptoms. Overall, their findings support the idea that psychosis
develops from a young age. It is possible that there is childhood
trauma, from parental separation during the move, to simply the process
of moving. There can also be problems with language and assimilating to
a new culture, leading to social exclusion that can amplify the risk of
developing psychosis. Social exclusion within the community and even
within the family can potentially influence a child&#8217;s dopamine levels,
a neurotransmitter directly associated with schizophrenia.
Additionally, viral infections and Vitamin D deficiency have been seen
to be additional factors influencing the probability of developing
psychosis, and Veling et al. mention recent findings that show that
high and low vitamin D levels are associated with schizophrenia.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it would be best to study the effects of
immigration and psychosis in each individual county, it is difficult
because census data does not take into account an individual&#8217;s age of
migration in most places. However, it has been found that in the United
States, there is a relationship between age of migration and mood and
anxiety disorders. Although these are not directly related to
psychosis, they are at least related to psychiatric disorders. The
United States is a country of different ethnicities, and these findings
shed an interesting and important light on immigration and mental
health.<br />
