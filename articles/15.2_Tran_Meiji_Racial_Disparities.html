<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="breast cancer racial disparity" src="15.2_Tran_Meiji_Racial_Disparities.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Breast cancer is among the most prevalent types of cancer diagnosed in
women around the world. With more than 130,000 cases in the United
States per year, it occurs in 1 out of 3 cases of cancer in American
women. A plethora of risk factors determine the probability of
developing breast cancer, including socioeconomic status, timing of
detection, and availability of treatment. An investigation of the
trends in breast cancer incidence and survival rates in the US reveals
discernible ethnic disparities between African American and Caucasian
women. What, then, are the various breast cancer risk factors that
account for these ethnic disparities?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, socioeconomic factors and lifestyles
among women bear strong relationships to breast cancer incidence. Women
with low incomes enjoy fewer advantages of health care and tend to live
in neighborhoods with poor environmental conditions such as air
pollution, unclean water, and toxic waste. Lack of wealth also leads to
unhealthy dietary consumption of inexpensive fast foods, typically high
in fat and low in nutrients, which contribute to obesity, which poses a
risk for breast cancer. A higher number of African American women
belong to low income groups in comparison to Caucasian women, and hence
are at greater risk of developing the disease.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Age is also a significant risk factor for developing
tumors in general as well as specifically in the breast. In recent
years, the incidence rates for the entire population have been
substantially higher in women ages 50 and older. However, since women
younger than 50 years comprise 73 percent of the female population,
approximately 23 percent of breast cancers are diagnosed in this age
group. Breast cancer is often detected at an earlier age for
African-American women than for Caucasian women, and this accounts for
the disparity in incidence. Age-specific incidence rates prove to be
slightly higher among African Americans aged 35 and younger compared to
Whites aged 35 and younger. This trend eventually reverses as
Caucasians have substantially higher incidence at later ages.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the various prognostic factors, the presence
of estrogen receptors (ER) in breast tumors predicts positive responses
to treatment. According to G. Shyamala, PhD, researcher at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, ER-positive tumors &#8220;are considered to be
hormone-dependent. These tumors will respond to anti-estrogen therapy
such as tamoxifen.&#8221; Availability of treatment explains why ER-positive
tumors are less detrimental for women with breast cancer. However, when
the onset of the breast cancer arrives at an earlier age, a more
aggressive disease occurs with tumors that are largely ER-negative.
African American women tend to have high-grade ER-negative tumors.
However, even after adjustment for age, studies demonstrated that
African- American women continue to have higher chances of developing
high-grade tumors than Caucasian women. Overall rates of survival have
increased within the last two decades, but since the 1970s, the
survival rates for African-American women with breast cancer have
remained lower than those of Caucasian women. In short, lifestyle,
socioeconomic factors, and biological differences may account for the
ethnic disparity in breast cancer incidence and survival rates.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the information presented in this report
underscores the need to inform all women, regardless of ethnicity and
socioeconomic status, about the risk factors of breast cancer in order
to prevent the development of more aggressive stages of disease.
Greater efforts should be exerted toward providing equal access to
prevention, detection, and treatment of breast cancer. In order to
eliminate the inequality that exists in access to detection and
treatment amongst women, clinicians should identify patients at high
risk for breast cancer and offer them appropriate referrals,
screenings, and treatments. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although very little is known about the genetic and
non-genetic factors triggering the racial disparities in breast cancer
between African-American and Caucasian women, future research for
determining the risk factors will result in a better understanding of
the cancer itself. As technology advances, a great deal of progress
must also be made to ensure that medical professionals and informants
completely and equitably apply this knowledge to women of all ages,
races, and class statuses. Not only can scientists and clinicians
expand the knowledge base concerning breast cancer, but women can also
contribute to the prevention of the disease by actively educating
themselves and participating in routine mammogram screenings.<br />
