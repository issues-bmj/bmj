<p><small><br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="clock age alcar la lipoic acid carnitine acetyl atp" src="13.2_Zadran_S_Turning_Back.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Aging is a universal phenomenon characterized by a general decline in
the physiological competence of cells, tissues, and organs. Because of
its combined popular and academic appeal, much research has been done
to understand the aging process with the hope of ameliorating the loss
of function with age. Unfortunately, most attempts to develop relevant
interventions have failed. Recently, however, a team of investigators
under the leadership of Bruce Ames, PhD, professor of biochemistry at
the University of California, Berkeley, has concocted a supplement via
rigorous scienti&#64257;c studies that appears not only to help repair the
physiological damage that accumulates with age, but also to reverse
certain parts of the aging process itself.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, this supplement consists of two
endogenous metabolites, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) and R-&#945;-lipoic acid
(LA). That a supplement containing ALCAR and LA can be used to combat
the deleterious e&#64256;ects of aging is not surprising in light of the free
radical theory of aging. As its name implies, this theory postulates
that the harmful e&#64256;ects of aging are caused by the accumulation of free
radical-induced oxidative damage within cells.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mitochondria convert chemical potential energy in
organic compounds into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) &#8211; the &#8220;energy
currency&#8221; of cells &#8211; but they also contribute to the accumulation of
free radicals and oxidative damage in cells. During ATP production,
electrons from various donors travel through an electron transport
chain within the inner mitochondrial membrane, ultimately reducing
molecular oxygen to water. In this process, approximately two percent
of the electrons leak out of the chain and reduce molecular oxygen to
the superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide. The leakage of oxidants
from the electron transport chain appears to be unavoidable. These
oxidants, in turn, can partake in harmful biochemical reactions
throughout the cell.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of their close proximity to these oxidants
and their limited antioxidant capacity, the mitochondria are extremely
vulnerable to oxidative damage. Obviously, the accumulation of these
oxidants is time-dependent, explaining the strong correlation between
age and mitochondrial decay. Furthermore, an age-related decrease in
cardiolipins&#8212;the phospholipids in the mitochondrial membrane that serve
as cofactors for a number of critical mitochondrial transport
proteins&#8212;exacerbates the mitochondrial decay. As the mitochondria
become more damaged, cellular function generally becomes less e&#64259;cient.
This global decrease in cellular e&#64259;ciency may underlie the decrease in
physiological competence seen with aging.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how do ALCAR and LA combat mitochondrial decay?
ALCAR is derived from L-carnitine, a common nutrient that is required
for the transport of long fatty acid chains into the mitochondria for
&#946;-oxidation, ATP production, and the removal of excess short and medium
chain fatty acids. ALCAR is used in lieu of L-carnitine in the
supplement because it enters cells and crosses the blood-brain barrier
more e&#64259;ciently. LA, also found in the supplement, is a coenzyme that is
involved in carbohydrate utilization necessary for the production of
ATP in the mitochondria. Here, LA is usually reduced to dihydrolipoic
acid, a powerful antioxidant.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Ames who has examined the role of these
metabolites in mitochondrial decay and aging extensively, &#8220;both
[metabolites] complement each other well and together o&#64256;er the optimal
defense against mitochondrial decay.&#8221; Ames&#8217; recent work examines the
exact function and bene&#64257;ts of the use of these mitochondrial
metabolites, especially the delaying of mitochondrial decay in the
brain.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the February 2002 issue of the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Science, Ames published several studies that
examined the e&#64256;ects of supplementation with metabolites on the
age-associated mitochondrial decay in both the brains of aged rats and
cultures of human neurons. In these studies, the ALCAR/ LA supplement
improved the age-associated decline of ambulatory activity and memory,
partially restored mitochondrial structure and function, inhibited the
age- associated increase in oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and
nucleic acids, and elevated the levels of antioxidants. These
mitochondrial metabolites have also been found to protect neuronal
cells from neurotoxin- and oxidant- induced toxicity and to inhibit
oxidant-induced acceleration of senescence.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, these supplements have not only been
observed to decrease the rate of mitochondrial decay but also to reduce
and reverse the degenerative processes of aging, an achievement unlike
any other. Ames has extended this study to humans, noting that &#8220;the
supplements have displayed positive results amongst the studies done
with people as well.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For decades, science has attempted to understand,
treat, and ultimately prevent the degenerative e&#64256;ects caused by aging,
but what is our ultimate goal? Does man seek to prevent the
debilitating events of aging, improve quality of life, or introduce a
means for immortality? Momin Khan, a sixty-year-old taking supplements
composed of the two metabolites ALCAR and LA, describes that &#8220;as we
age, we see so many changes within ourselves. We become weaker,
everything takes longer to do, and we forget many things. We begin to
imagine the end&#8212;buried six feet under the soil, leaving everyone
behind&#8212;and we tremble. This fear of death is what drives us for longer
life. We not only seek a long life, but also a healthy life. If science
has come to a place where a single pill can give me a chance for a few
more years, a few more happy years, then sign me up for a lifetime
membership.&#8221; These new supplements seem to provide hope that a weapon
against aging may exist. However, only time can tell what role these
new supplements will have in man&#8217;s larger battle against the
ever-ticking clock.<br />
