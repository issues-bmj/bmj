<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Forty-four post-menopausal women participated
in a six-week double-blind study. Half the group added Athena Pheromone
10:13&#8482; to their perfume and the other half added a placebo compound. In
an article published in The Journal of Sex Research, principal
investigator Dr. Rako reported that &#8220;among postmenopausal women, a
significantly greater proportion of those using the pheromone than
those using placebo showed an increase over their own baseline in
intimate sexual behaviors.&#8221; The study reported that 41 percent of the
pheromone users experienced more petting, kissing, and affection with
partners compared with 14 percent of the placebo users. Furthermore, 68
percent of the pheromone group reported increases in &#8220;intimate
socio-sexual behaviors&#8221; such as formal dates and sex. Only 41 percent
of the placebo group experienced an increase in these behaviors. The
results were analyzed across age, height, weight, body mass index,
education, and numerous other factors to ensure that the pheromone had
indeed been the cause of increased frequency of sexual behavior. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the special ingredient in Athena 10:13&#8482;?
Although the exact chemical makeup will remain under wraps until a
patent has been granted, Dr. Cutler has disclosed that Athena 10:13&#8482;
does contain a synthetic blend that resembles women&#8217;s axillary
secretions. Axillary secretions are typically steroids produced by the
testes, ovaries, and adrenal glands. Though humans typically have far
fewer scent glands than do other animals, the human axillary scent
glands (located primarily in the hollow of the upper arm and shoulder)
are actually quite large and contain a high density of apocrine glands.
These apocrine glands produce a number of steroids, three of which are
hypothesized to be human pheromones&#8212;androstenone, androstenol, and
androstadienone. Only a marginal amount of steroids are released into
axillary sweat, producing virtually no detectable odor. Instead,
axillary coryneform and coccal bacteria convert these steroids into
more aromatic molecules.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other pheromonal evidence includes the
well-documented menstrual synchrony due to communal exposure to
axillary odors. Such synchrony exists in mammalian species such as
rats, hamsters, and some primates. Numerous studies report
synchronization of menstrual cycles among roommates, close friends,
co-workers, lesbian couples, family members, and women&#8217;s sports teams.
In a similar vein, studies show that the presence of men accelerates
the menstrual cycles of women, supposedly due to their axillary
pheromones. Women who see men socially at least three to four nights a
week have significantly shorter menstrual cycles than those who do not.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of the sexual dimorphism of the axillary
scent glands and of menstrual synchrony supports the theory of axillary
steroids as human pheromones. Studies in which women were exposed to
the airborne axillary steroid androstadienone, the epithelial cells of
the female VNO showed an electrochemical response. Exposure to airborne
estratetraenol&#8212;a steroid found in pregnant women&#8212;produced similar
effects in men. When exposed to the airborne estratetraenol, men (but
not women) showed electrochemical responses in the epithelial cells of
the VNO. MRI analysis of the men showed increased activity in certain
areas of the brain. Furthermore, exposure to androstadienone and
estratetraenol was also found to alter skin temperature and conductance
in both sexes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If human pheromones do exist, it is necessary to
consider the ramifications of social customs that encourage the removal
of natural odors. Do such institutionalized customs handicap nature&#8217;s
intended mode of sexual communication? A study in 2001 reported that
while humans do replace their natural odors with artificial ones, their
personal selection of these replacement odors is determined by their
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genetic patterns. Both men and
women seem to prefer axillary odors of people who have MHC patterns
dissimilar to their own. Could this mean that opposites really do
attract? While this remains a distinct possibility, it is important to
remember that whatever effect human pheromones may have taken place
within the context of other complex physiological, psychological, and
sociological factors. <br />
