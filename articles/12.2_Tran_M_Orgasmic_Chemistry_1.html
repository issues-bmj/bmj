Sex is a constant source of fascination, conversation, and
investigation, yet ambiguities still abound in the realm of human
sexuality. Science has collected mounds of physiological facts on
orgasms but has been unable to solve one of its most controversial
mysteries: what is the purpose of a female orgasm? <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The orgasm can be considered only one of three
components that make up a sexual climax. According to Gemma O&#8217;Brien,
Ph.D., a University of New England physiology and human biology
lecturer, the sexual climax involves the natural responses of the
reproductive tract, including ejaculation, viscerosomatic changes such
as an increased heart rate, and various brain responses. &#8220;It&#8217;s in the
brain that orgasm occurs&#8212;all of that psycho-physiology, the &#8216;happy&#8217;
experience,&#8221; says Dr. O&#8217;Brien.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Victorian Era, doctors believed orgasms
to be a natural cure for hysteria and prescribed masturbation. Hysteria
was considered an incurable and chronic illness that afflicted
approximately 75 percent of women. Hysteria, Greek for uterus, was
diagnosed as the &#8220;malfunctioning of the womb.&#8221; Its symptoms included
lassitude, irritability, forgetfulness, depression, headaches,
insomnia, heart palpitations, insatiable arousal, and vaginal
lubrication. However, since sexuality was suppressed in the Victorian
Era, doctors could have misinterpreted a woman&#8217;s libido as hysteria.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darwinian theorists believe that every evolutionary
adaptation fulfills a specific function, and one early explanation of
the female orgasm was the &#8220;pole axe&#8221; theory. This idea holds that
orgasms act to sedate women after sex, facilitating insemination by
keeping her recumbent and allowing her time to retain sperm. However,
this &#8220;would not account for a woman&#8217;s multi-orgasmic capacity,&#8221; says
Ian Kerner, Ph.D., author of the New York Times best-seller She Comes
First: the Thinking Man&#8217;s Guide to Pleasuring a Woman. Furthermore,
nature does not guarantee that all women climax during intercourse, so
the &#8220;pole axe&#8221; theory is considered by many to be a dubious argument.
Theories about the adaptive value of the female orgasm are prolific,
but what if there is no value in orgasms at all?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late Harvard evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould argued
that the clitoris is simply the by-product of the fact that men and
women are developmentally similar. In embryos, the penis and the
clitoris start off as identical organs that develop differently under
the influence of hormones. Gould insisted that the clitoris is
comparable to the male nipple and serves no adaptive purpose at all;
the design of the female genitals does not even allow for easy
stimulation for her to orgasm through intercourse. Moreover, female
orgasms are usually achieved through experience, which contributes to
the idea that the clitoris is purely vestigial. Gould often emphasized
that chance events and structural constraints play major roles in the
evolutionary process. For him, the question of the female orgasm
provided a classic instance of why scientists should not always assume
that every trait contains an adaptive value. Nevertheless, various
scientists have rejected Gould&#8217;s notion that female orgasms are a relic
of nature&#8217;s negligence.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some scientists suggest that the orgasm evolved in
order to inspire feelings of intimacy and trust between lovers because
a hormone known as oxytocin, which creates sensations of ecstasy, is
released in the brain at the point of orgasm. Laura Hill-Sakurai, M.D.,
assistant professor of the Department of Family and Community Medicine
at the University of California, San Francisco, challenges Gould&#8217;s
ideas, declaring that the clitoris is &#8220;not like the male nipple, which
is just hanging there without causing trouble. The female orgasm is
there for a reason. It builds intimacy and encourages communication.&#8221; <br />
