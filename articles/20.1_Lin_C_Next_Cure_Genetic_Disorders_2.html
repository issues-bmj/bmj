<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from The Next Cure for Genetic Disorders<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Corey explained that this &#8220;technology
hasn&#8217;t been pursued earlier because no one knew that the [central
nervous system] was such a good target for antisense oligonucleotides.
Regarding ss-siRNAs, dogma in the field stated that ssRNAs would be
rapidly degraded and could not work efficiently inside cells.&#8221; While
siRNA has great potential for curing any deformed cell, the most
precedent issue is effective delivery to various parts of the body.
They usually only travel a short distance or are damaged before
reaching the target. Researchers are finding ways to modify these
customized siRNA such that they will not only travel to the target, but
also retain their designed therapeutic properties.&nbsp; While
double-stranded siRNA is more stable, it cannot travel far within the
brain, causing treating large brain areas to be difficult.&nbsp;
Furthermore, compacting double-stranded siRNAs is complicated and
difficult to execute, therefore impractical to use. Fully complementary
siRNAs (also known as ASOs) has shown effective inhibition, but little
selectivity. Even &#8220;fully complementary duplexes function through an
siRNA pathway that involves cleavage of target mRNAs, whereas
mismatch-containing duplexes presses translation.&#8221;1 The studies about
selectivity of these double stranded complexes have proven favorable,
but they are not potent enough to treat the mutation.&nbsp; Therefore,
the ideal strategy to silencing HD expression is combining ASOs&#8217;
potency and double stranded RNAs&#8217; selectivity. The solution is using
modified ssRNA, an amalgamation of said ideal features.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reduce the negative effects of RNA interference
(RNAi) that prevents double-stranded from reaching the target cell by
breaking it down, researchers want to modify the double-stranded siRNA
into a single-stranded siRNA to allow further travel. Unlike the
double-stranded version that is not only good at gene silencing, but
also stable, the single-stranded form is neither stable nor effective
in gene silencing. However, it has the ability to travel larger
distances. In hopes of remedying this dilemma, David Corey, a Professor
at University of Texas&#8217; Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, in
collaboration with ISIS pharmaceuticals has teamed up to find a
compromise. Corey was able to modify the siRNA such that it could be
easily packed in a simple saline solution, eliminating the
complications caused by the bulkiness of duplex RNA that inhibits
transportation.&nbsp; Other researchers are also improving the
transportation and undesired interactions of siRNA with the rest of the
cell by adding a bulge to the siRNA, such that there is a higher chance
for the ASOs to interact with it, increasing specificity as a result.
The injected ss-siRNA, the modified single-stranded RNA, seeks out
mismatched bases, which were predicted to inhibit HTT expression.
Corey&#8217;s results have shown that ss-siRNA is not only potent in
suppressing the HTT expression, but also it is a highly
allele-selective inhibitor of the gene, up to twenty-nine folds better.
It has shown to specifically target the CAG repeats with the same
potency as ASOs. These results imply that chemical modifications and
precise positioning of mismatched nucleic bases affect
allele-selectivity and gene silencing. While the effects were not
permanent, lasting about two weeks in the rat models, these results at
least allow the potential of effective medication. A potential drawback
of using ss-siRNA is it potentially inhibiting other gene expressions
that are base on CAG codons.&nbsp; Corey and his associates did test
for this possibility, and fortunately, there has been little to no
signs of inhibiting other important expressions such as the
TATA-box-binding proteins or androgen receptors. While these promising
results were from rat models, they are suggestive of the beneficial
effects of modified single-stranded RNA for humans diagnosed with
Huntington&#8217;s Disease.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This technology has proven promising for
Huntington&#8217;s Disease, but its potential is endless. Taking control of
siRNA, control over the body on a molecular scale is possible. Control
of siRNA is controlling/manipulating DNA. As Dr. Corey put it, &#8220;in
theory, this should work with any type of cell.&#8221; This would allow a
remedy for almost any disorder or disease, regardless if it is
genetically-linked or not. However, he also mentions that &#8220;there is a
potential for toxicity, and managing [it] will requre...careful
analysis of result and subsequent chemical modification to improve
properties...[However], we are off to a good start.&#8221;<br />
