<h3 style="text-align: center;">Magic Mushroom's Alteration of Blood Flow for the Treatment of Depression<br />
</h3>
<br />

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="mushroom psilocybin blood depression fmri" src="19.2_Tafarella_B_Magic_Mushroom.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sense of euphoria, hallucinations, the perception
of geometric patterns, and an overall dream-like state are all
subjective effects created by psilocybin, the naturally existing
psychedelic compound found in magic mushrooms. These perceptions caused
by psilocybin culminate in a spiritual, or out-of-body, experience that
are said to have contributed to indigenous healing rituals. In more
modern times they have been explored for their use as treatment for
depression, anxiety, and alcoholism. Despite the long history of the
use of magic mushrooms, little is still known about how their
subjective effects are generated in the brain.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, recent studies have made progress
in the investigation of the physiological effects of psilocybin. In
November of 2011, Robin L. Carhart-Harris and researchers at Imperial
College London, University of Bristol, Cardiff University, University
of Oxford, and University of Copenhagen collaborated on a study that
used fMRI imaging, a technology that monitors changes in blood flow to
different areas of the brain while a mental process is performed. An
increase in blood flow to an area correlates to increased activation in
that area of the brain. The researchers monitored the changes in blood
flow to different areas of the brain before, during, and after the
administration of psilocybin to human subjects. A total of fifteen
healthy and psychedelic-experienced subjects went through a series of
trials in which they entered the fMRI machine and were either injected
with a placebo solution or a moderate dosage of 2mg of psilocybin. The
subjects were all monitored with a fMRI to image the switch in blood
flow from normal consciousness to the psychedelic state. The subjects
were also asked to rate the intensity of their subjective effects by
pressing certain buttons that correlated with relative intensities
throughout the duration of the scan. These rating alongside the
acquired fMRI images allowed the researchers to map blood flow in the
brain against the intensity of the subjective effects.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results from this study show that with
increasing intensity of psilocybin's subjective effects, there is
increased deactivation of important connector hubs in the brain,
represented by up to 20% decrease in blood flow. Connector hubs are
important brain networks that regulate and constrict information flow
between different areas of the brain. Deactivation of connector hubs by
psilocybin thus allowed for an unrestricted style of cognition.&nbsp;
This means that the connector hubs were prevented from weeding out and
downgrading the significance of certain perceptions and emotions that
the body experienced.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two main connector hubs that showed
drastic deactivation after the administration of psilocybin were the
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC). Both of these connector hubs have a strong function in
self-referencing and the creation of our ego.&nbsp; The ego satisfies
our needs of identity which include the juxtaposition of self versus
other, the reduction of importance of emotional stimuli and the
relation of self to societal standards. Patients with depression have
abnormally high activity in the mPFC, which explains why the
psychopathology of depression follows intense self-focus and comparison
with inner standards. Psilocybin, like the class of antidepressants
called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), lowers blood
flow to the mPFC. Psilocybin and SSRIs both decrease blood flow by
blocking the receptors of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates
the constriction of capillaries. It usually goes that if there is a
decrease in blood flow to one area of the brain, there is heightened
blood flow to a different area of the brain.<br />
