The label on the bottle says, &#8220;Take 3 pills per day, 1 pill 30 minutes
after every meal, for 7 days.&#8221; While the directions sound simple
enough, actually taking prescribed pills according to the instructions
provided by the doctor may not be so easy. A lot can happen within the
30 minutes after a meal; going to lecture, getting dessert, drinking
coffee, etc., which can all divert one&#8217;s attention from remembering to
take that pill. When confronted by the doctor at a follow-up
appointment on whether the medication was taken regularly, it may be
difficult to &#8216;fess up&#8217; and admit to the still-full bottle of pills on
your desk. Aside from the obvious statement that it is important that
prescribed pills be taken in concordance to their assigned time and
amount, doctors also need to be aware of when patients are not taking
their pills so that prescriptions can be adjusted. To provide a more
honest interaction that does not leave room for excuses between a
doctor and his patient, digestible microchips embedded in drugs are
being developed which tells doctors whether a patient is taking their
medications as prescribed. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is surprising how many people forget to take
their pills; rest assured, you are not the only one who has skipped out
on their medication. According to Eric Topol, director of the Scripps
Translational Science Institute at La Jolla, California, that number is
quite large: &#8220;about half of all people don&#8217;t take medications like
they&#8217;re supposed to.&#8221; At the level of Tylenol or Dayquil, not abiding
by the &#8216;take two tablets every 6 hours&#8217; might not seem like a big deal,
but certain medicines may have dangerous consequences if they are
skipped. One example is antibiotics. According to the Food and Drug
Administration, if the full course of antibiotics against an infection
is not taken as prescribed, a small number of bacteria may remain and
these can multiply and spread to create a new strain that has
resistance to antibiotics. Known as Methicillin-Resistant
Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infections, these types of bacteria can be
especially hard to kill with antibiotics currently on the market and
may even end up being fatal to the patient. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A digitized pill can overcome the problem of
untimely medicine consumption. Any regular oral pill can become
&#8216;digital&#8217; by embedding a microchip into it, which functions as a
sensor. These sand grain-sized sensors are composed of a minute silicon
chip containing trace amounts of magnesium and copper. Once the pill
with the implanted microchip reaches the stomach after being swallowed,
the sensor generates a slight voltage in response to the digestive
juices. This reaction sends a signal to the surface of the person&#8217;s
skin, where a patch then relays the information to a mobile phone
belonging to a healthcare provider. Developed by a company in
California called Proteus Digital Health, these sensors were recently
approved by the FDA and the analogous regulatory agency in Europe after
they passed safety and efficacy tests. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, despite the solutions these digital pills
offer in terms of monitoring patients&#8217; medicine uptake, there have been
voices of concern regarding this technology. Firstly, what gives
doctors the right to monitor patients as though the patients are
children? To this, George Savage, co-founder and chief medical officer
at Proteus, replies that the purpose of the sensors is not for doctors
to castigate people, but to understand how patients are responding to
treatments. If someone is found to have difficulty taking his pills on
a regular basis, the healthcare provider may use this information
provided by the microchips to prescribe larger dosages that may be
taken less frequently or suggest a different treatment altogether.
Secondly, how will these microchips affect the price of medicine?
Currently, the sensor has only been tested on a select number of
placebo pills. In the future, Proteus hopes to produce the sensors in
bulk, which will make them cheaper - the company&#8217;s target is a penny
per pill. Although this technology is still undergoing development, the
age of digital medicinal care may be fast approaching in the
foreseeable future. In a world where everything is becoming digitized,
even pills are turning &#8216;smart.&#8217;<br />
