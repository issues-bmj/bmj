<p><small><br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="drug fda disease advertisements r&amp;d" src="13.2_Han_E_Attention.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you turn on the television, how many advertisements for the
so-called &#8220;life-style drugs&#8221; &#64258;ash before your eyes? Need Viagra® or
Levitra® for erectile dysfunction?&nbsp; How about PropeciaTM for
baldness, or XenicalTM for obesity?&nbsp; Got acne? Maybe Proactive®
can help. The list goes on. But where are the ads for life-saving
drugs?&nbsp; Does it really come as a surprise that, according to the
Global Forum for Health Research, only 10 percent of the pharmaceutical
industry&#8217;s research and development (R&amp;D) e&#64256;orts are targeted at 90
percent of the global disease burden?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act passed by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1983, a neglected disease is
any disease that: &#8220;(a) a&#64256;ects less than 200,000 persons in the United
States, or (b) a&#64256;ects more than 200,000 in the United States and for
which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing
and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or
condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such
drug.&#8221;&nbsp; In truth, neglected diseases are essentially those for
which there are inadequate pro&#64257;t incentives to perform R&amp;D,
resulting in a lack of therapeutics despite the widespread existence
and often crippling nature of these maladies. Unfortunately, but not
unexpectedly, these are also the diseases that a&#64256;ect the world&#8217;s
poorest people.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although basic research is performed on the
neglected dis- eases, industrial entities lack incentives for expanding
upon most of this research. This disconnect between basic research and
preclinical trials&#8212;aptly termed the preclinical gap&#8212;is one of three
gaps between research at the bench and drug delivery to the
masses.&nbsp; In the article &#8220;Drug development for neglected diseases:
A de&#64257;cient market and a public health policy failure,&#8221; published in the
June 2002 issue of the Lancet, Patrice Trouiller, PharmD, and
colleagues of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, report that between
1975 and 1999, out of the 1,393 new drugs made available to the public,
only 16 were meant for neglected diseases.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second gap is a pro&#64257;t-based gap. According to
William Fisher III, PhD, Hale and Dorr Professor of Intellectual
Property Law at Harvard University, in 2002, 94.9 percent of the global
sales of U.S.-based brand-name pharmaceuticals came from Northern
America, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. Because clinical
development is very expensive, developing a drug for a neglected
disease that is not marketable in high income countries is &#64257;nancially
risky.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, even after development, there is often
an access gap resulting from problems regarding the registration for
the distribution of the drugs in other countries, lack of production,
high prices, and drugs being poorly adapted for non-industrialized
conditions such as hot climates.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, even if a treatment for a disease
exists, price mark-ups may be so high that these drugs are virtually
inaccessible in countries where people live on less than one U.S.
dollar per day.&nbsp; Due to these gaps between research and access,
millions of people die every year from preventable and curable
diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp; But while there are many obstacles between
R&amp;D and the promotion of global health, universities may act as
powerful players in bridging the gap between research and
healthcare.&nbsp; Because many universities have the potential to
become major players in the pharmaceutical market, some people suggest
focusing advocacy e&#64256;orts there.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should time, funding, and energy be spent on
universities?&nbsp; Even though the pharmaceutical industry, like any
other business, has a goal of maximizing pro&#64257;ts, there is potential for
universities to signi&#64257;cantly bridge the gap between research and access
to medicines if they change their licensing practices to address the
R&amp;D and access gaps.&nbsp; First, the principles that guide a
university are the creation and provision of knowledge for the public
bene&#64257;t&#8212;a creed that runs parallel to the goal of improving global
health.&nbsp; Additionally, universities are playing an increasingly
larger role in biomedical research and medical training. According to
Francis Narin, PhD, and colleagues in a 1997 article published in
Research Policy, patenting activity in the universities is of great
importance because approximately 50 percent of the drug industry&#8217;s new
products rely heavily upon academic research.&nbsp; Since academic
research sets the foundation for further development by the
pharmaceutical industry, universities are in a position to successfully
improve access to essential medicines in lower and middle income (LMI)
countries. <br />
