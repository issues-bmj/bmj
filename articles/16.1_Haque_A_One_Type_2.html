<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While ZymeQuest® first developed
prototypes of its machine in the 1990s, it was not until recently that
it found the enzymes that make it fully functional. According to Samira
Johnson, the vice president of marketing and business development at
ZymeQuest®, &#8220;what we have been able to pull from [certain] bacteria is
an enzyme that can take those terminal sugars off.&#8221; Although many other
bacterial enzymes have been found to strip these sugars off of red
blood cells, all previous options have damaged the cell in some way
until now. The enzymes that provided the breakthrough for the invention
were first discovered in 2007 by a research team led by Henrik Clausen,
PhD, at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. After examining more
than 2,500 fungi and bacteria, the team observed that only enzymes from
Elizabethkingia meningosepticum and Bacterioides fragilis can safely
strip the sugars covering red blood cells.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the complication involved in its creation,
ZymeQuest®&#8217;s machine functions in a very straightforward manner. Blood
that is going to be converted is first transported into a sealed
container to prevent contamination. The previously mentioned enzymes
are then added to convert the blood cells into O-type by latching onto
and stripping off the antigenic sugars on non-O-type blood. Finally,
the machine washes the blood cells, cleaning away the removed sugars
and enzymes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The machine, however, is unable to remove the Rhesus
factor, a protein that determines whether a blood cell has the RhD
antigen or not (and is thus labeled positive or negative,
respectively), so the machine does not make the blood cells completely
universal. Because the Rhesus factor&#8217;s proteins are located inside the
blood cells, there is no simple way to remove them without damaging the
cell in the process. Nevertheless, converting all blood into O-type
does greatly simplify the problem of blood types, as blood transfusions
would only need to be divided into positive and negative O-types.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the universal blood machine has been proven
to convert human blood types into O-type, ZymeQuest® is still in the
process of refining the procedure. However, Johnson says that the
company has &#8220;done physical trials in humans and [has not encountered]
safety issues and no physical conditions.&#8221; The company must also obtain
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, which involves several
tests to ensure that blood from the machines is identical to
unprocessed O-type blood.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After these goals are achieved, ZymeQuest® will be
permitted to sell the machine to hospitals and blood banks.
Nonetheless, Garratty still remains skeptical. Although the machine
promises great changes, it may &#8220;take many years to convince the FDA
that [these new approaches] are efficient,&#8221; Garratty points out, &#8220;It
will be a few years down the road before we will actually be able to do
it.&#8221;</small><br />
