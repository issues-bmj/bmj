As children, we were warned that coffee would stunt our growth, and as
young adults, we are still told that coffee is deleterious to our
health. When compared to tea, coffee&#8217;s reputation is anything short of
healthy, but prospects may soon change for this dubious drink.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a new study conducted by the American
Medical Association, coffee may offer protection against Parkinson&#8217;s
disease. This disease, caused by the degeneration of neurons in the
substantia nigra region of the brain, afflicts approximately one
million Americans. Neuronal degeneration causes the levels of the
neurotransmitter dopamine to fall, and muscle control is greatly
hindered.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers in the Honolulu Heart Program, who
studied the effects of coffee on patients, conducted experiments with
coffee consumption and the occurrence of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. The test
subjects consisted of 8,004 Japanese-American men who were studied over
the span of 30 years. Of those studied, 102 eventually developed
Parkinson&#8217;s. However, the incidence of the disease was substantially
lower in those individuals who drank 28 ounces of coffee regularly. Men
who drank the most coffee had the smallest chances of getting
Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and those who had not consumed any coffee were
five times more likely to show symptoms of the disease.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does coffee specifically reduce the risk of
Parkinson&#8217;s disease? Coffee consists of caffeine, a type of xanthine
neurotransmitter. Adenosine is another xanthine neurotransmitter used
in the brain. As soon as adenosine receptors get blocked, as is the
case with Parkinson&#8217;s disease, the level of dopamine neurotransmitters
in the brain fluctuates. Caffeine may protect against Parkinson&#8217;s by
out-competing dopamine for blocking adenosine receptors and increasing
levels of free dopamine within the brain. However, there is a
trade-off: coffee consumption causes caffeine to bind to the adenosine
receptor. Reducing caffeine intake makes the body oversensitive to
adenosine. As a result, blood vessels in the brain dilate, causing an
excessive amount of blood to flow to the head and blood pressure to
quickly drop, leading to the infamous &#8220;caffeine withdrawal&#8221; headache.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As ideal as it may sound, to state that caffeine
will eliminate Parkinson&#8217;s disease would be a stretch. Many outside
factors have the possibility of biasing the data. For instance, certain
individuals who enjoy the taste of coffee could be genetically
predisposed to resist the neuronal degeneration that causes
Parkinson&#8217;s. Furthermore, in the research conducted by the Honolulu
Heart Program, only Japanese men were studied. The effects of coffee on
women or other ethnic groups have yet to be understood. Although
concrete evidence in the near future might support the claim that
caffeine eliminates Parkinson&#8217;s, this does not mean that individuals
should consume large amounts of coffee in hopes of avoiding the disease.<br />
