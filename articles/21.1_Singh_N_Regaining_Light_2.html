<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked why he chose to apply his
research to these two diseases, Schaffer stated the need for the
development of an efficient and less invasive vehicle to transmit genes
to compromised cells of the body. AAV, although a type of virus, is
relatively benign, he states. In fact, most people inhale it, just like
a cold virus, but it does not seem to elicit any harm to the body.
Albert M. Maguire et al. have already utilized AAV&#8217;s to cure LCA II,
but the procedure involved injecting the viruses into the back of the
retina, a procedure surgeons refer to as a sub-retinal injection.
Utilizing sub-retinal injections to cure other genetic disorders of the
eye like retinoschisis or retinitis pigmentosa would exacerbate the
patients&#8217; conditions, and so researchers had to investigate other
avenues to find a cure.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schaffer and his team did not use the
natural version of the AAV&#8217;s, but rather cut out the viral genes in
their DNA, and replaced them with the corrective genes. This processing
of the virus facilitated the intravitreal injection procedure, a much
easier surgery that takes a mere 15 minutes compared to the sub-retinal
injection procedure, which requires a more qualified surgeon and a
longer operation. Hence, according to Schaffer, if the FDA approves of
this treatment, it will be more readily available to patients. The
procedure is still in the clinical trials phase, but the reports
indicate that it is inducing an improvement in vision.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retinitis pigmentosa, retinoschisis, and
LCA II are not the only retinal degenerative conditions that there are.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a condition that progressively
causes vision impairment as individuals age, is equally as
debilitating, if not more. The Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group
did a study in 2004, in which it collected data on the white and black
populations separately who were older than 40, and based on recent
population-based studies, it estimated that 1.47% of people above 40
had AMD, amounting to 1.75 million citizens. Furthermore, by 2020,
AMD&#8217;s prominence would grow to 2.95 million citizens.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Argus II and David Schaffer&#8217;s
research have made incredible inroads into solving the retinal
degenerative conditions, but according to Anthony Burkitt, director of
Bionic Vision Australia, another group developing retinal implant
systems, there is still a lot to do: &#8220;Retina prostheses are at the
stage cochlear implants were 30 years ago. That technology went from
being an aid for lip reading to the point now where children with a
cochlear implant can go through normal school and even use mobile
phones.&#8221; With the number of diseases increasing day by day, researchers
like David Schaffer and those from Second Sight are going to be
increasingly in demand. Hopefully, they will continue to succeed in
their endeavors and bring light to the eyes of millions more.<br />
