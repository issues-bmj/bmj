<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, research asserts that the levels of
HCAs in cooked meats drastically increase the chances of developing
different types of cancer. Many global epidemiological studies have
tested whether the amounts of HCAs in cooked meats are significant
enough to induce carcinogenesis in humans. &#8220;Seventy-seven percent of
these studies show a correlation with eating overdone meats and cancer
of one type or another. Breast, prostate, colon, [and] stomach stand
out as the most suspect,&#8221; proclaims James Felton, PhD, who is head of
the Molecular Toxicology Group of the Biology and Biotechnology Program
at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Malfatti agrees, but urges caution. &#8220;Since we
can&#8217;t do carcinogenicity studies in humans, all we have to go by is
animal data. All the HCAs that have been tested in animals have been
tumorigenic,&#8221; he notes. The HCAs have seemed to produce liver, colon,
mammary, and prostate tumors in rats as well as lymphomas in mice. &#8220;So,
there may be some cancer risk from consuming well-cooked meats over a
lifetime exposure, but there are no definite conclusions that can be
made. Personally, I think that there is enough scientific evidence to
indicate that the HCAs do pose a cancer risk and that you should limit
your exposure.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, a lot can be done. &#8220;The best way to
limit your exposure is to not cook your meat to well done status. By
cooking [it] medium [well,] you can reduce the time it takes to cook
your meat, thereby reducing the amount of HCAs formed significantly,&#8221;
advises Dr. Malfatti. &#8220;Also if you marinate your meat before cooking
you can reduce the amount of HCAs formed by ninety percent.&#8221; Marinating
meats before cooking provides a barrier between the cooking surface and
the meat, which prevents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the meat from reaching
excessively high temperatures. Additionally, &#8220;marinating would increase
the amount of liquid in the meat, and the more liquid there is, the
longer it takes the meat to dry out [in order] to get to the
temperature that is producing those chemicals,&#8221; articulates Dr.
Bjeldanes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HCAs are not commonly formed in foods like
vegetables and grains due to their low creatine content. Therefore,
cooking garden or tofu burgers might be a safer alternative to burgers
made with meat. Eating more vegetables and less meat would also reduce
HCA ingestion. If using vegetable alternatives is not an option,
cutting the meat into smaller pieces and cooking at low temperatures
reduces the concentration of HCAs.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions remain regarding the interaction of HCAs
with other foods. &#8220;Prevention foods and their role in dietary exposures
need to be understood. [We need to know] how other foods prevent,
metab[olize] or detoxify HCAs,&#8221; says Dr. Felton. Researchers hope that
in a few years they will be able to identify certain chemicals in food
like fruits, vegetables and grains that can protect us from these
chemical carcinogens. The ultimate goal is to produce drugs that
effectively treat or prevent cancer. Maybe after some time we will be
able to cook our meat thoroughly and eat it too. But until then, be
cautious the next time barbeque Sunday rolls around!<br />
