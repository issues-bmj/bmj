<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; The orgasm might have also developed as an
evolutionary pleasure mechanism to promote procreation: &#8220;It would seem
that the pleasure is a means to an end&#8212;rather like the selfish gene,
except this is a generous gene,&#8221; says Dr. O&#8217;Brien. &#8220;In &#8216;carrot and
stick&#8217; terms, the carrot of pleasure is held out to encourage us to
mutually stimulate the two sets of external genitalia, with the
ultimate goal for the organism being procreation.&#8221; Not only do orgasms
affect bonding between couples and promote procreation, but some argue
that they also encourage women to prefer one mate over others.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last decade, scientists have proposed that
the female orgasm is an advanced adaptation that allows women to
subconsciously decide when and by whom she will conceive. In 1993,
British biologists Robin Baker, Ph.D., of the University of Manchester,
and Mark Bellis, Ph.D., Director of the Center of Public Health, tested
the &#8220;up-suck&#8221; hypothesis, which suggests that women do not always
orgasm during intercourse because they favor certain sperm over others.
Baker and Bellis discovered that orgasms that occur between one minute
before and 45 minutes after ejaculation allow women to retain
considerably more sperm than they would during non-orgasmic sex. The
muscular contractions allow the sperm to enter the cervix more easily
and increase the sperm&#8217;s chances of encountering an egg. Multiple
orgasms boost the probabilities even higher. If women do not orgasm
during sex, little to no sperm is retained. &#8220;Maybe that is why so many
women are having problems with fertility these days!&#8221; says Kerner.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procreation also seems to have a biologically
instinctive aspect. For example, female animals, from insects to
mammals, prefer males with a high degree of body symmetry because they
have strong immune systems and are able to successfully forage for
food. In order to secure strong genes for their offspring, females will
look to the symmetrical male. Evolutionary biologists Randy Thornhill,
Ph.D., and psychologist Steve Gangestad, Ph.D., at the University of
New Mexico in Albuquerque have confirmed that this is also true in
humans. In their study from 1993, more women reported orgasms during
intercourse with symmetrical mates. This supports the theory that the
female orgasm is, indeed, an adaptation for sperm selectivity.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far, not all scientists accept the female
orgasm as an adaptive trait. If the proadaptation theory is correct,
then a healthy couple experiencing difficulty conceiving might find a
solution in uterine contractions. However, even if Gould has been
correct all along, and the female orgasm is not a clever result of
adaptation, its value still does not diminish. Dr. Hill-Sakurai
asserts: &#8220;the female orgasm is a biological process, but you can&#8217;t
separate it from psychology. Regardless of what it evolved for, there
is value in a couple&#8217;s attempt to understand it.&#8221; </small><br />
