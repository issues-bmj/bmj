<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Mind Over Matter</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICMS is the bread and butter of
neuroscience. For decades, almost centuries now, neuroscientists have
employed the use of ICSM to infer much our basic knowledge about how
the brain is organized. In effect, by stimulating different parts of
the brain and observing the physiological responses of the body,
scientists have developed a map of the brain, partitioning it into
regions corresponding to the physiological responses. By iterating
through various simulations at a range of voltage thresholds at
different parts of the cortex, scientists constantly update the map to
more accurately reflect the localization of function, or physiological
response, in the brain.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, Carmena and Overduin have
successfully modelled&nbsp; how the brain controls movement by looking
at brain activity. In modeling how the brain controls movement they
have essentially solved the first part of the CLDA, enabling them to
applying their understanding toward developing a simple device. In the
simple neuroprosthetic device, the decoders are biomimetic, &#8216;that is,
[decoders] that mimic how the brain controls movement by reading and
decoding brain activity,&#8217; Overduin posits.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem with developing
neuroprosthetic devices that subscribe to this first approach is that
simple decoding fails to tap into the brains ability to adapt to
external devices, making improving and getting better at a task
virtually impossible.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, Overduin thinks that with
the right algorithms the brain can eventually learn, like the soccer
player, to adapt and improve itself through a feedback mechanism.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;We experience neuroplasticity every time
that we have to learn a new skill, to adapt to change in our bodies as
we fatigue, get older, get injured, wear a cast. All of those
adaptations rely on the brain&#8217;s own mechanisms for adapting to changes
in the musculoskeletal system. One approach is thus to put in a BMI,
and regardless of the quality of the decoding, to rely on the brain&#8217;s
own ability to adapt to the BMI, or in other words to help with the
decoding process itself. With this second approach, you could exploit
the brain&#8217;s own ability to adapt to and the decoder by replanning its
movements in a fashion the decoder will understand. While this approach
has utility for neuroprosthetics, this plasticity takes a while,
occurring over days and weeks.&#8221;</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even with a smart enough decoder
and plastic enough brain, the learning curve for a given task seems to
be too high. In order to facilitate learning and help the brain teach
itself, the decoders need to be cleverly engineered to integrate
algorithms that adapt to the &#8216;brain&#8217;s movement plans.&#8217;</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;This third approach takes advantage of
the fact that plasticity in the decoder can be much faster than the
brain&#8217;s own mechanisms of neural plasticity,&#8221; Overduin said.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step toward developing
neuroprosthetics for human subjects are improvements in the &#8216;realm of
miniaturization, energy storage, and biocompatibility&#8217; according to
Overduin. In their current state, BMIs are not built to last a
life-time, which poses huge practical problems.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Widespread application of this work to
patients is still premature, in my opinion, as so much still has to be
done on the engineering and testing side. Noninvasive technologies are
still able to offer better outcomes for all but the most paralyzed
patients, even those whose control is limited to their fingers, or
their eyes. Invasive BMIs are hard to justify unless they can offer the
patient more dimensions of control, and also survive within the patient
for many years,&#8221; Overduin cautions.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond having an expiration date, BMIs are
not yet sophisticated enough to completely restore mobility in people
suffering from tetraplegia. In the case of the soccer player, simple
changes to a player&#8217;s practice schedule and routine can ultimately
yield better results and performance. However, in the case of the
individual suffering from tetrapalegia, making lifestyle changes is not
nearly as easy, since these individuals suffer physically from
corticospinal damage and cannot start walking until they regain control
over their motor cortex.&nbsp; With the right assistance and methods,
researchers are hopeful that neuro-corticospinal disorders will be
curable in the near future.&nbsp; Though significant progress has been
made in terms of giving more control to subjects over neuroprosthetic
devices, there is a lot more left to learn before we start seeing BMIs
treatment as a standard medical procedure. Advances in neuroprosthetic
devices and BMIs will hopefully treat neurological problems that
afflict people everywhere.</small></p>
