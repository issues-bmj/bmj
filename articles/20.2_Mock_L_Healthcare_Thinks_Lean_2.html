<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Healthcare Thinks Lean<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the benefits, lean approaches often
spark fears of Taylorism, the work design theories promoted by
Frederick Winslow Taylor in his ground-breaking work, The Principles of
Scientific Management (1919) that has often been criticized for its
emphasis of the operational aspects of work over human factors. Thus,
lean implementations in healthcare often encounter resistance. It seems
patently obvious that human patients in need of medical services are
not spark plugs or steering wheel columns, to be mass manufactured off
an automotive assembly line. Highly educated medical care professionals
who self-actualize in their career through greater job responsibility,
planning, and expert problem-solving skills loath working in a
mechanized environment. The operational approach of lean thinking can
neglect human, cultural factors that are essential to the experience of
quality by both patient and healthcare professionals.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet fears of the ignorance of human factors had been
largely unfounded. In practice, lean organizations implement
operational aspects of lean thinking in parallel with programs that
serve the healthcare professional, such as extensive training, internal
consultancies, internal promotion, or pay for performance incentives.
These programs imbue a culture of quality and motivate healthcare
managers and professionals to take leadership in driving continuous
improvement.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the application of lean thinking may itself
provide the catalyst for job improvement. Standardizing a task does
reduce complexity and promotes repetition to reduce errors, but
standardized jobs may no longer challenge highly trained physicians.
However, standardization enables less trained workers to take over the
job and frees the physician to tackle complex patient cases that
challenge the physician&#8217;s expertise. Thus, lean does not prescribe nor
interfere with treatment, but frees up the physician resource to become
more productive.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, since the introduction of lean thinking
at the Toyota assembly lines, the understanding of &#8220;lean&#8221; has and
continues to evolve. Today, lean thinking encompasses both operational
and human behavioral aspects in an integrated approach. Barbara B.
Flynn and E. James Flynn, in their article, &#8220;An exploratory study of
the nature of cumulative capabilities,&#8221; (2004) submit that an
integration of both operational and cultural initiatives can amplify
process improvements beyond what operational or cultural changes can
achieve alone. This combination of operations and cultural changes
provide a more holistic approach that considers the general systemic
effects of change and better gauges results from the time and effort
invested.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous success stories promoted by the lucrative
cottage industry of lean management consulting continue to lure
hospitals toward lean implementations. Research continues to explore
factors that mediate the success or failure of lean implementations.
While certainly not a panacea for all the troubles with the American
health care system, lean thinking, by improving healthcare processes,
promises to deliver healthcare quality while reducing healthcare costs.
This improved allocation of healthcare resources is one important piece
of the puzzle in helping hospitals address the healthcare crisis. <br />
