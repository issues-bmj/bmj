For most people, the phrase &#8220;time flies when you&#8217;re having fun&#8221; is
merely a figure of speech to account for the feeling experienced during
enjoyable situations when time seems to rapidly elapse. However, this
notion of fleeting time is in fact a biological process known as
interval timing, a previously mysterious phenomenon that one recent
study may now shed light upon. Duke University neurobiological research
team, led by Warren Meck, PhD, and Catalin Buhusi, PhD, narrowed the
source of interval timing to the brain&#8217;s basal ganglia. This discovery,
published in the October 2005 issue of Nature Reviews Neuroscience, may
one day allow humans to control the way they interpret time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the past few years, Meck and Buhusi have been
examining time perception in patients suffering from mental disorders,
particularly in patients with Huntington&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s disease,
both of which are characterized by abnormal function within the basal
ganglia, an aggregate of nuclei in the brain. This region has long been
implicated in central timekeeping functions since its nerve cells
primarily contain the neurotransmitter dopamine. For example,
Huntington&#8217;s disease results from the genetically-programmed
degeneration of neurons, specifically those in a structure of the basal
ganglia known as the striatum, which plays an integral role in the
timekeeping process. Furthermore, dopamine levels within the basal
ganglia are so abnormally low in Parkinson&#8217;s disease patients that they
experience difficulties in time perception. These levels improve to
some extent when patients are administered drugs that restore optimal
levels of dopamine in the brain.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By studying the relationship between timekeeping and
medication, Meck and Buhusi have discovered the link between abnormal
brain activity and time perception. They concluded that interval timing
is in fact a cognitive process known as the striatal beat frequency
model. In this model, every organ in the body oscillates to a certain
beat. These pulsations eventually reach the brain, where they are
sensed by the basal ganglia. The striatum then interprets the
oscillations to form a mental clock, allowing the brain to calculate
the duration of an action by the number of vibrations that occur during
the event. This allows us to keep track and interpret incidences that
last longer than a few seconds.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, most neurobiologists split time
perception into three categories: circadian rhythm, millisecond timing,
and interval timing. The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle that
functions as a biological clock for nearly all higher-order organisms.
At the other extreme, millisecond timing is responsible for our
perception of events during periods shorter than a second. For years,
the basis for the third type of timekeeping, interval timing, was
unknown.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was known about interval timing was that it
serves as the middle ground, allowing humans to understand actions that
occur within a time frame ranging from a few seconds to several hours.
It coordinates a wide range of actions, such as communicating, eating,
and working. While the basis for both circadian rhythm and millisecond
timing has been fairly well studied, investigation into interval timing
has been stagnant until now.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meck and Buhusi are currently refining the
understanding of this process. For example, they have determined that
one of the main components of interval timing is the neurotransmitter
dopamine. By altering dopamine levels, Meck and Buhusi hope to
understand the direct relationship between the neurotransmitter and the
striatum. They have also mentioned that by controlling dopamine levels,
humans could one day distort their perception of time, an effect
already achieved by certain narcotics such as cocaine and cannabis.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If scientists are able to find chemicals which have
specific effects on time perception, then they may be able to create
drugs specially designed to alter human awareness. By taking a certain
chemical, students could get through a boring lecture in only a few
minutes or make a fun game seem to last for hours. Since interval
timing is also responsible for getting people into the zone, &#8211; a
feeling of deep concentration that usually results in an increase of
productivity &#8211; neurobiologists may one day discover a drug that could
compel people to focus intensely on a task, increasing their
productivity and quality of work. However, Meck and Buhusi admit that
since further research into the specifics of interval time perception
is needed, there is still a long way to go before medicine reaches this
point.<br />
