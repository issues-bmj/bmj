<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Certainty of Memory is Questionable in the Criminal Justice System<br />
</h3>

Witness testimony in judicial court has long been considered an
integral part of what the ultimate verdict of the court is upon the
defendants, but scientists continue to question how much a person can
really remember factually. This question has great implications for the
criminal justice system, and suggests that adjustments need to be made
in order to account for the ambiguity of memory.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years with the development of
DNA identification methods in crime investigations, it had been found
that 75% of convictions proven wrong by DNA were due to faulty witness
testimony. As recently as November 2011, the United States Supreme
Court began the Perry v. New Hampshire case involving a man who was
convicted of theft after being accused by a woman who saw him at a
distance in the obscurity of night. Even in August of the same year,
the New Jersey State Supreme Court formed new guidelines to assuage the
faults of witness testimony during the appeal of Larry Henderson, a man
who was chosen from a photo lineup and later convicted of weapons
possession and manslaughter in 2003.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness accounts are unreliable due to the
selectivity of memory in the brain. The human brain has evolved to only
remember a rough outline of past events because it does not need to
have a detailed memory in order to promote the survival of humankind
according to Harvard psychology professor Daniel Schacter. In any given
situation, there is often a lot of information for humans to process,
so humans are more likely to focus on a certain event at any given
time. Consequently, it is very likely that the witness to the crime may
not have been paying attention to the event in question, thus skewing
their memory of the event, as according to Barbara Tversky, a
psychology professor at the Teacher&#8217;s College in Columbia University.
In the November New York Times article The Certainty of Memory Has Its
Day in Court by Laura Beil, Tversky says that the witness would have
trouble remembering the details well due to outside factors such as
their emotions during the event, the social pressures incurred by the
police and even additional information that the brain used to fill in
what the person did not remember that might not be true.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Memory can also be affected by what we
were concentrating on during an event. In a study from Harvard, when
asked to focus on how many times the white team passed a basketball,
subjects were so focused on the task that they did not even notice a
woman walking by in a black gorilla suit. More recently, the University
of London did a study presented to the Psychonomic Society that formed
an audio test similar to the Harvard study. Participants were asked to
listen to a 69 second recording of two men and two women talking and
preparing for a party while focusing on what the women said. Nearly all
of the participants did not hear a third man saying &#8220;I&#8217;m a gorilla&#8221; for
19 seconds in the middle. Visual distraction is not the only factor
that can affect memory.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly, fear combined with this
selective attention can cause people to become more affirmed in their
memory; they may have been focusing on the weapon in their fear, not
paying attention to much else, but that fear could influence them to
have paid much attention to that source of fear. As such, the witness
would be confident about what happened that was in the scope of their
concentration, but then they may apply that confidence to other aspects
of the event on which they were not as focused.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers are trying to find ways to
excise such falsities from witness comments, especially in suspect
line-ups, a source of many inconsistencies in witness accounts. Gary
Wells, a psychology professor at Iowa State University, released a
study which showed that the likelihood of choosing the wrong person
from a police lineup decreased from 18% if suspects shown side-by-side
to 12% if shown sequentially. It is believed that the sequential method
limits the amount of people the suspects can be compared to; in the
line-up, there is likely to be someone who looks like the suspect more
than the others, but is still not the suspect in side-by-side line-ups.
Dr. Wells suggests that police make sure that the witnesses know that
the criminal is not necessarily in the group and having the line-ups
done by a person who does not know who the suspect is. The authorities
may be asking the wrong questions of the witnesses, telling them to
choose the criminal or say exactly what happened when their minds may
not be able to do exactly as they are told. If measures are made to
counter the ambiguity of memory in witnesses, the criminal justice
system could be more accurate and improved overall.<br />
