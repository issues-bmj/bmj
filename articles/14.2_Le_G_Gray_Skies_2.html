<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever the case may be, many consumers do not
fully understand what SPF really means. James Cleaver, PhD, at the
University of California, San Francisco, clarifies that &#8220;SPF is a ratio
of the amount of time needed to reach the same degree of sunburn with,
as compared to without, the sunscreen; it is only relative. Therefore
staying out in the sun longer with sunscreen will reach the same level
of damage as a shorter time without sunscreen.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the SPF factor is an accurate measure
for only a limited number of sun-related dangers. Cleaver notes that
&#8220;it is important to realize that sunscreen ratings are usually based on
protection against erythema, or sunburn, mainly due to the UVB
wavelengths. The cancer-causing wavelengths may extend into the UVA
range, [but] SPF ratings have not been usually measured in this range.&#8221;
Although an accurate measurement for UVA blocking effectiveness is
currently not available, there are key ingredients to be mindful of
when purchasing sunscreens for UVA blockage. A February 2002 Medscape
online article by Shane Chapman, MD, from the Dartmouth-Hitchcock
Medical Center in New Hampshire, lists several effective sunscreen
agents, including titanium dioxide, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and
its derivatives, camphor derivatives (Mexoryl SX, ecamsule), and the
benzotriazoles (Tinosorb).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these compounds, some dermatologists say the most
effective is Mexoryl SX. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated both
histologically and clinically, as outlined in the book Sunscreens:
Development, Evaluation, &amp; Regulatory Aspects by Nicholas Lowe, MD,
from the Skin Research Foundation of California in Santa Monica. People
in countries like Brazil, France, and Australia have been using
sunscreens with these added ingredients much longer than Americans
have. In fact, this year marks the anticipated approval by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) of the first and only sunscreen with Mexoryl
sold in America, marketed as L&#8217;Oreal Anthelios SX SPF 15.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, most dermatologists believe that the
currently available sunscreens work very well even without Mexoryl.
&#8220;Physical sun-block agents, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide,
are the best protection against UVA and UVB,&#8221; says Jenny Kim, MD, PhD,
at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California,
Los Angeles. These physical sun block agents absorb or reflect UV rays
off of the surface of the skin, whereas chemical agents are absorbed by
the skin to deactivate UV rays.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where can consumers go from here? Is it worth the
trouble to slather yourself with sunscreen or should you throw in the
towel? Just because sunscreens are not perfect does not mean they do
not block a significant amount of UV rays. When purchasing sunscreens,
check for effective ingredients, apply liberally, and reapply
frequently if outside for extended periods of time. Other ways to
minimize UV harm include taking extra precautions by wearing protective
clothing on foggy days, at high latitudes, and near reflective
surfaces. &#8220;But people should remember that sunscreen is the third line
of defense against UV radiation,&#8221; notes Kim.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts are clear: the sun is causing more damage
to more people every year. With a rise in global warming and a
depleting ozone layer, the urgency to protect yourself from the harmful
UV rays is greater now, more than ever. With better sun safety habits,
you can prevent skin cancer that kills thousands of people every year
while defying the wrinkles of age. You can look younger and live longer
if you are sun smart!</small><br />
