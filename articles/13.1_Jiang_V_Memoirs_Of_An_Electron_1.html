An Egyptian belief articulates that an immortal soul exists within the
human body, housing the unique character of each individual. If this
were the case, then could it be possible for us to transfer an
individual soul from one body to another through organ transplantation?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1988, after having undergone a lung and heart
trans- plant, a health-conscious dancer and choreographer reported that
she was experiencing mysteriously uncontrollable urges for Kentucky
Fried Chicken nuggets&#8212;the same food that was found in the donor&#8217;s
pocket when he was killed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 1980s, Thomas Budinger, MD, PhD, a
professor of bioengineering and electrical engineering at the
University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), also encountered a
case of a transplant patient acting like the donor. This patient had
received a liver transplant. &#8220;I was on a ski trip with my family in
Squaw Valley when a mysterious person, knowing I was a transplant
surgeon, knocked on the door of our cabin and asked if I would come
look at a female liver transplant patient who seemed to be acting crazy.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I went, and when I got there the first thing I
did was search through the patient&#8217;s purse. In her purse I discovered
immunosuppressive drugs that had been prescribed by Thomas Starzel, an
old friend. And so, I called Starzel and told him, &#8216;I have one of your
patients here, and I was wondering what we could do because she&#8217;s
acting schizophrenic.&#8217; At that point Starzel said, &#8216;Oh my God, the
patient isn&#8217;t schizophrenic, but the liver was from a schizophrenic
boy.&#8217;&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For decades now, it has been accepted that
subconscious, behavioral memory is stored in the nervous system, mainly
in the brain. In fact, experiments involving lesions of different
sections of the brain have shown exactly where and how memory is
stored. Scientists have observed through magnetic resonance imaging
that the activity of neurons in the same area of the cerebellum
increases as a conditioned behavior is developed. Such conditioned
behaviors may range from simple skeletal muscle reflexes to classically
conditioned responses to stimuli. In fact, scientists have found that a
lesion of specific sites in the cerebellum can eliminate conditioned
responses. Richard Thompson, PhD, professor of behavioral neuroscience
at the University of Southern California, successfully tested this
claim in an experiment during which he eradicated an eye-blinking
reflex by lesion of the anterior cerebellar interpositus nucleus, one
of the two main sections of the cerebellum involved in retention of
conditioned behaviors.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous studies have also suggested a possible
molecular mechanism of memory storage. In order for a memory to be
made, an individual must first detect stimuli from his surroundings.
This information is then encoded into short-term memory before being
transformed into long-term memory through consolidation, a process
involving the expression of genes and the synthesis of new proteins.
The structural changes caused by the new proteins may, in turn,
facilitate the stable storage of memories.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the strong experimental support for such a
localized mechanism of memory formation and storage, the idea that
memory can be transmitted without actually transferring any part of a
person&#8217;s brain seems completely fictitious. To Gunther Stent, PhD,
professor of neurobiology at UC Berkeley, and many others, the idea
that organ transplants can transfer such feelings as cravings for
Kentucky Fried Chicken is ridiculous. Dr. Stent comments, &#8220;It might
have been that the person just craved meat because the donor&#8217;s heart
has that physiological need for a lot of meat, or maybe there were
hormones in the hospital that triggered some craving for fried food,
but a craving for KFC is just too specific&#8230;the heart is just a pump.&#8221;
Yet, various independent reports of interpersonal memory transfer
suggest that there may be something transferred during an organ
transplantation besides the organ itself.<br />
