<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Orthokeratology<br />
</small></p>

<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the few risks of orthokeratology
that causes lasting damage to the patient is infection, a risk that any
contact lens wearer faces. There have been reports of infectious
keratitis &#8211; inflammation of the cornea that causes watery, pain in the
eyes, and blurred vision &#8211; related to overnight orthokeratology lens
wear in China. Although rare, eye infections are painful and, in worst
cases, can lead to permanent vision loss. But Walline explains that the
risk of severe problems can be greatly decreased by educating patients
and emphasizing proper hygiene. With careful contact lens use,
infections are highly unlikely to occur. &#8220;[In Asia,] [the lenses] were
dispensed by literally anyone without follow- up,&#8221; explains Walline.
&#8220;After the government stepped [in] to regulate who could dispense the
contact lenses, the number of eye infections dramatically decreased.&#8221;<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orthokeratology has been particularly
popular in the Asian market, largely because nearsightedness is more
prevalent in Asia. Recent studies have also found that orthokeratology
slows the progression of nearsightedness in children, thus causing
concerned parents to seek out orthokeratology and optometrists to
recommend the procedure. &#8220;The clinicians have noticed that the patients
treated with orthokeratology tend to have very stable prescriptions,
compared to other patients who wear glasses, who tend to have faster
progression of myopia,&#8221; says Maria Liu, MD, OD, PhD candidate at the
University of California, Berkeley, School of Optometry, who is
currently researching how and why orthokeratology prevents myopia.
Although child subjects would be ideal for her research, Liu is bound
by child safety regulations and has been working with college students
because rules for their participation are much less stringent. Since
myopia correlates with nearsighted-work, students doing regular
intensive reading also experience progressive myopia past their
developing years, making them a suitable target population for this
research. Although Liu&#8217;s research has yet to see progress in reversing
nearsightedness, it does imply that adults can also benefit from
orthokeratolgy&#8217;s effect of slowing down myopia.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, orthokeratology does not
work for every patient. &#8220;About 20 percent of people have difficulty
adjusting to gas-permeable contact lens wear,&#8221; says Walline. &#8220;So they
find out within the first week or two that [orthokeratology] is not for
them.&#8221; Walline adds that the treatment does not work for extremely
nearsighted people either. At this time, there are no Ortho-K lenses
with corrective methods designed to treat patients with more than six
diopters of myopia. Also, the development of this field is affected by
the popularity of other options for vision correction. &#8220;It will depend
on whether or not the contact lenses get better, in terms of comfort
and wearability,&#8221; comments Polse. &#8220;Orthokeratology became popular
because people didn&#8217;t want to wear glasses and they didn&#8217;t like
contacts, and they didn&#8217;t want refractive surgeries, either. If a
person could put a contact lens in their eye and wear if for a month
without ever taking it out, and it&#8217;s safe and comfortable, there would
be very little interest in orthokeratology.&#8221; Since it has its own
unique benefits, orthokeratology can still complement other treatments,
even if it may not replace them.<br />
