&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I get by with a little help from my friends," sang
the sensation band, The Beatles. More so than ever, this statement
rings true as scientists have found that people have millions of
"friends", or microbes, living inside them which help their bodies do
things such as absorb nutrients and balance the immune system. Due to
the incredible abundance of microbial life in the human body,
scientists are hard at work figuring out exactly how these microbes
interact with the body. However, at the University Of North Carolina
School Of Medicine, a recent study shed light on a particular microbe
that lives within the digestive system and increases the absorption of
calories. While an increased absorption of calories can be beneficial
in some cases, in many it is not. The discovery of a microbe that
contributes to this condition has the potential to alter the way
obesity is treated and prevented in modern-day medicine.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obesity, its causes, and what can be done to
prevent it have come to the forefront of society since the number of
people suffering from this condition has skyrocketed in the past twenty
years. Doctors and scientists have performed countless studies to
diagnose the causes of weight gain and obesity. They have made
connections between weight gain and diet, sleep patterns, and exercise
habits, but there are assuredly more to be found. For example, few have
investigated microbes as a factor in obesity. However, the digestive
system is the perfect place to start when looking into a disease that
revolves around food and how the body uses it. When people eat, their
food goes through a complex tour of the human body. From the esophagus
in the throat, to the stomach and through both the small intestine and
the large intestine, there are many places for microbes to live and
collect calories from the passing food.&nbsp; This means more
opportunities to glean the maximum nutrients from food, which are
stored in the body as fat. The presence of microbes that specialize in
absorbing the maximum amount of calories from a minimal amount of food
could be another factor of obesity. Perhaps, as long as this microbe is
in the body, exponentially increasing an obese person&#8217;s calorie intake,
the person would have much greater difficulty losing weight and would
be more likely to remain either obese or overweight.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the University Of North Carolina School Of
Medicine, a team of scientists have been performing experiments to
investigate microbial function within the digestive system. It was
already known that microbes assisted with the digestion of complex
carbohydrates, which make up sixty percent of an average person&#8217;s daily
carbohydrate consumption. The way they helped to metabolize the fat
harvested from these complex carbohydrates (which are strings of sugar
molecules) has remained unknown until now. In a study led by Ivana
Semova, a team of researchers fed fatty acids to baby zebrafish. These
fatty acids were tagged with fluorescent dye, which could be tracked as
they traveled through the zebrafish, which are transparent at a young
age. While some fish were fed these fatty acids daily, others were
denied food as a comparison. The fish that were fed fatty acids
developed a higher concentration of microbes in their digestive system;
hence, the researchers identified more fluorescent fatty acids absorbed
into digestive cells. The fish that were denied food had significantly
less fatty acid in their digestive cells than did the others, which
showed the researchers that this microbe&#8217;s presence in the body is
based on diet. The researchers were able to identify this microbe as a
part of the phylum Firmicutes, species Exiguobacterium. Because the
specific organism responsible for the increase in fat absorption is
known, scientists have been able to do more research in different
species to see just how prominent Firmicutes bacteria are. Similar
tests have been executed with mice, rather than fish, as the subject.
Like the zebrafish, the mice fed fattier diets had a more abundant
Firmicutes population in their digestive system than those mice fed
low-fat diets. They also gained more weight in fat, which reinforces
the correlation between the presence of Firmicutes and weight gain. In
humans, those suffering from obesity have also been documented to have
more Firmicutes bacteria than individuals of good health. <br />
