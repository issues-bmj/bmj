&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, hospitals have been applying lean
thinking, a process improvement approach originating from manufacturing
industries, to redesign healthcare processes to improve the quality of
care while controlling and reducing costs. Implementing lean
methodologies involves not only a focus on operational aspects of
healthcare processes, but also consideration for human and cultural
factors as well.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under pressure from a stagnant economy, government
agencies, payers and insurers have passed the impact of financial
tightening to hospitals by reducing reimbursements. In response to this
financial crisis, hospitals have aggressively pursued cost reduction
initiatives to maintain their shrinking margins. Despite these
reductions, medical professionals and healthcare consumers continue
their demands to provide or receive quality care. To resolve these
seemingly opposing requirements, healthcare has looked to other
industries for solutions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In translational medicine, medical innovation and
pharmaceutical discovery borrow process knowledge from research and
development in high tech industries to accelerate the delivery of new
drugs and medical procedures to market. Likewise, lean healthcare
borrows process know-how in manufacturing and production from, of all
places, the automotive industry, to improve processes to achieve rapid,
high quality delivery of healthcare at low cost.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key components of lean thinking were first pioneered
at Toyota Corporation when Taiichi Ohno and Dr. Shigeo Shingo designed
the Toyota Production System, incorporating innovative principles such
as Just-in-Time delivery to customers of products in the right quality
and quantity, and at the right time. These process contributions have
proven effective when deployed in a manufacturing environment.
Fortunately, lean thinking is generic. It supports process improvement
along any value stream and can be applied to any workflow. From
automotive manufacturing, lean thinking diffused to other industries,
including healthcare.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones coined the word
&#8220;lean&#8221; to describe this type of highly efficient product
delivery.&nbsp; In their influential book, Lean Thinking: Banish Waste
and Create Wealth in Your Corporation (1996), the authors describe
value as a &#8220;capability provided to customer at the right time at an
appropriate price, as defined in each case by the customer.&#8221; In
particular, lean thinking, as Womack and Jones wrote, can be used to
&#8220;specify value, line up value creating actions in the best sequence,
conduct these activities without interruption whenever someone requests
them, and perform them more and more effectively.&#8221; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operational principles of lean thinking focus upon
customer value and the needs of a customer. This concern helps
distinguish the various steps of a value creation activity, the value
stream. For example, one value stream in a hospital is the patient
treatment value stream which may involve steps like admissions,
evaluation, testing, treatment, and finally, discharge. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a value stream, value adding steps contribute
directly to creating the product or service a customer demands.
Non-value adding steps, such as waiting, excess inventory, remediating
mistakes, or unnecessary movement do not. Other steps cannot be
eliminated given the limits of current technologies, but may be
required such as record-keeping or reporting.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steps of the value stream that do not add value for
a customer are wasteful. They consume the hospital&#8217;s money, capacity,
time and other resources. For example, in a patient value stream, much
of a patient&#8217;s time is spent wastefully waiting. With the objective of
eliminating or reducing waste, lean methodologies employ methods such
as synchronization of tasks, standardization of work to make tasks
simple and repetitive to reduce errors, and reducing or eliminating
inventory. Applying lean thinking to healthcare processes reduces
waiting times, minimizes re-admission rates, saves money through cost
avoidance, and decreases lab turnaround times. These techniques drive
efficiency, productivity, and timely, error-free delivery that lower
the costs of care. <br />
