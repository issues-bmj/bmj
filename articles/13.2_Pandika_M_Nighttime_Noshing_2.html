<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Cameron&#8217;s &#64257;ndings agree with earlier studies
that reported a low correlation between nighttime eating and subsequent
weight gain. A ten-year study of over 7,000 people by Queens College of
the City University of New York published in May 1997 found that the
extent of evening eating was not a signi&#64257;cant predictor of long- term
weight gain. Another study by Queens College in 1995 on<br />
1,802 women between the ages of 19 and 50 found that body mass index
(BMI) was not associated with percent energy of evening food intake.
Moreover, a 1990 study by the Faculté de Medecine X in Paris, France on
the relationship between circadian distribution of energy intake and
obesity found that obese subjects did not consume higher proportions of
their daily caloric intake during dinner than non-obese subjects.
Instead, obese subjects had a higher total daily caloric intake than
their non-obese counterparts.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these &#64257;ndings, there is still room for
skepticism. Several studies have shown, for instance, that obese
individuals consume a greater proportion of calories at night than
their leaner counterparts. A 1988 study conducted at the University of
Paris reported that obese and overweight children ate less at breakfast
and more at dinner than their leaner peers. Furthermore, a 2000 study
by the New York Obesity Research Center found that night shift workers
ate later and gained more weight on average than those who worked
during the day.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, research has focused on sleep
deprivation and nighttime levels of ghrelin, a hormone produced by the
stomach that stimulates appetite in response to hunger. Ghrelin
concentrations in the blood follow a daily cycle, reaching high
concentrations at night, possibly explaining the association between
sleep deprivation and weight gain observed in large populations. In the
December 2004<br />
Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Stanford University researchers examined
1,000 individuals, measuring each person&#8217;s sleep habits as well as
ghrelin levels. The study found that decreased sleep was inversely
proportional to BMI levels and that ghrelin levels were 14.9 percent
higher in individuals who slept &#64257;ve hours or less per night compared to
those who slept eight hours per night.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, Cameron&#8217;s &#64257;ndings are substantial and
have profound implications for a nation in which obesity has reached
epidemic proportions and more individuals are obsessed with losing
weight than ever. This study is particularly useful because it
addresses the major problem with obesity research today: ambiguity in
reporting just how often human participants actually eat and exercise.
In primate studies, however, subjects are constantly under the watchful
eyes of researchers and their food may be pre-measured, allowing for
greater experimental control. Cameron plans to implement her primate
model in future research on factors leading to individual di&#64256;erences in
weight gain among people who consume high-calorie diets, such as
di&#64256;erences in metabolic rate, physical activity, and absorption of
nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract.<br />
