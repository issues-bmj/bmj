is a highly measurable activity. In soccer, we can count exactly how
many times any given player touched the ball or scored a goal to derive
a rough idea of how productive any given player was in a given match.
If a player frequently touched the ball but never scored, we might
think he or she was less productive in a game than a player who touched
the ball less but scored more. Likewise, in neuroscience, we can count
exactly how much brain activity is occurring in any given part of the
cortex and correlate this activity with a cognitive test to&nbsp; get a
rough idea of the cortices&#8217; productivity. As you might expect, with
practice, repetition, and a bit of determination, a soccer player can
become more productive (score more goals), while touching the ball
less. How is this possible? Individual soccer players can actively use
their teammates in an attack, passing the ball more and dribbling less,
for example, to move the ball up the field and ultimately score
goals.&nbsp; Neuroscientists at the Carmena Lab in the Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of
California, Berkeley&nbsp; are investigating this concept of neural
recruitment in people suffering from tetraplegia, a severe neurological
and corticospinal disorder causing a loss of mobility and basic motor
control. Leveraging the power of Brain-Machine-Interfaces (BMIs) and
Closed-Loop Decoder-Adaptations (CLDAs), researchers are attempting to
make the brain more effective at completing given motor control tasks.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor of Electrical Engineering Jose
Carmena and MIT Neuroscience PhD Simon Overduin are taking the lead in
developing BMIs, or small, implantable computers connected to the brain
via an electrode.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Traditional BMIs including the ones in
our lab are strictly focused on reading out, or decoding information,
from the brain. They are not concerned, yet, with putting information
into the brain, or replacing information that would come in through the
senses.&nbsp; There are a couple of labs out there that are working in
this direction,&#8221; Overduin said.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an interview with Overduin, when asked
if this is the future of neuroprosthetic devices he replied with
unwavering resolve; yes.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Designing better brain machine
interfaces, through understanding what the brain is planning during
movement, and efficiently translating those decoded intentions into
control signals for a neural prosthetic device or simulation&#8221; is the
next step, Overduin suggests.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some neuroprosthetic device companies like
BrainGate have harnessed the power of brain machine interfaces,
effectively enabling subjects to regain motor control by interpreting
signals sent from their brains while they imagine and think about using
their limbs. In a human trial, funded by the National Institute of
Health in 2012, BrainGate released a video on YouTube displaying a
person with tetraplegia using a robotic arm to execute a complex
reach-and-grasp motion to pick up a bottle all with her imagination.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the many research projects currently
in the works, developing smarter CLDAs to increase the voluntary
control of neural activity in the brains of subjects suffering from
tetraplegia is a primary one. The basic idea behind traditional CLDAs
and BMIs is that a computer is implanted in the brain and connected to
a part of the motor cortex via an electrode. In a given motor task, the
brain sends impulses to the computer, which runs a series of algorithms
governed by four vectors, representing the kinematic state of the
actuators, or limbs. The computer first receives two different
electrical impulses from the brain at two different times.&nbsp; It
then derives an algorithm modeling the two electrical signals and
relating them by comparing the vectors associated with the signals and
produces a prior estimate, or an initial estimate. The prior or initial
estimate is then used to determine the values of the vectors associated
with the intended movement projected by the brain.&nbsp; Finally, the
computer predicts the next movement based on the initial estimate to
form the posterior estimate, the final estimate, effectively updating
the signal or impulse to be better and more accurate in respect to the
intended movement. After updating the signal or impulse, the computer
closes the loop by sending the updated signal or impulse, via precise
and calculated intracranial microstimulation (ICMS). This closing step
of the loop via ICMS is the mechanism defining the &#8216;closed&#8217; part of the
Closed Loop Decoder Adaptation. Ultimately, Carmena and Overduin are
investigating whether subjects will be able to use this closed loop
system to generate more accurate motor signals voluntarily effectively
using the the power of their minds.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What is microstimulation? It&#8217;s shocking,
if you will, the tissue right around the electrodes.&nbsp; The stimuli
are calibrated to be near the voltage threshold required to evoke a
movement. ICMS is intracortical microstimulation.&nbsp; It&#8217;s completely
painless, because there are no pain receptors in the brain. If applied
in the motor cortex, you can evoke a movement. If you apply it in the
visual cortex, you can evoke visual hallucinations,&#8221; Overduin explains.<br />
