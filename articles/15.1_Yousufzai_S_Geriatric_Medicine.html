<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Future of Geriatric Medicine<br />
</h3>
<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">A pending healthcare crisis?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sumrina Yousufzai<br />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Fall 2007<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="geriatric medicine healthcare" src="15.1_Yousufzai_S_Geriatric_Medicine.jpg.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" /></small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The current generation of baby boomers not only face inadequate
healthcare and reduced Social Security benefits within the next thirty
years but also a shortage of geriatricians as they become senior
citizens. As more than just end-of-life care, geriatrics has advanced
research in several different medical fields such as family medicine.
But now, as fewer medical students decide to enter the field, medical
researchers and professionals are concerned with how this field will
recover.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite its rise since the 1970s, the field of
geriatrics is expected to decline rapidly over the next 30 years. The
American Geriatrics Society estimates a reduced availability of skilled
geriatricians for future generations of the elderly. According to
Leslie Libow, MD, Professor of Geriatrics and Adult Development at the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, &#8220;The graying of America, a
triumph of medical and cultural advances, has caught us unprepared. Our
health care system is challenged by the sheer number of elderly people
and the demands of providing cost-effective care to those who are
frail.&#8221; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the nation&#8217;s aging population grows rapidly with
each passing year and more Americans outlive projected age limits even
with serious illnesses, the need for professionally trained and
experienced geriatricians is becoming increasingly important.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the American Geriatrics Society, all
baby boomers will have become age 65 or older by 2035, making that age
cohort 70 million strong. They estimate that there are 7,000
geriatricians in the US as of 2005, which translates to approximately
one geriatrician for every 5,000 adults aged 65 and older. By 2030,
that number is expected to decrease to one geriatrician for every 7,665
elderly adults.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seth Landefeld, MD, of the division of geriatrics at
the University of California, San Francisco, identifies &#8220;inadequate
reimbursements for time-intensive care of the aged&#8221; as one of the main
challenges that the future of geriatric medicine faces. &#8220;Medicare pays
nearly as much to freeze a benign skin lesion&#8212; which takes about a
minute&#8212;as it pays to spend 30 minutes with a patient and family sorting
out why the patient is less able to do things around the house than
what used to be the case,&#8221; Landefeld says.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Internal Medicine News, Steven A. Levenson, MD,
and President of the American Medical Directors Association, explains
that Medicare&#8217;s physician fee schedule for nursing home care urgently
needs to be adjusted to reflect the real costs of diagnosis and
treatment, since geriatricians often spend more time with their
patients for not only diagnosis and examination purposes but for
follow-up care and rehabilitation services. &#8220;Virtually all of our
patients move slowly and many think slowly, so they nearly all take
more time,&#8221; adds Landefeld.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasing the Medicare benefits for doctors will
not only increase medical student interest in geriatrics but also
motivate current geriatricians to continue their work and not abandon
the field for one that is more lucrative. This will pave the way for
more legislative changes that will protect the current elderly
population from substandard care and eventually create a workforce of
geriatricians to treat the future aging population of America.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stigma associated with the field of geriatrics
is that it is often considered end-of-life care rather than a
research-related medical field with the potential for future
advancements. However, as Libow notes, federally and publicly-supported
research in the field of geriatrics has established a wealth of
knowledge about heart failure, systolic hypertension, nutritional
problems, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and gait problems. Libow notes that
geriatrics &#8220;spans general medicine and surgery, neurology, psychiatry,
rehabilitation medicine, pharmacology, palliative care, and nursing
home medicine.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, although geriatrics primarily concerns
itself with the diseases and immediate medical concerns of aging, it is
a combination of palliative care, physical therapy, acute care, and a
variety of other medical fields. Most elderly patients have more than
three medical conditions, and geriatricians must, therefore, be capable
of managing the complicated health situation, rather than simply
providing end-of-life care.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to increase medical students&#8217; interest in
the field, Landefeld suggests that medical schools expose students to
the challenges, joys, and personal and intellectual rewards of caring
for older persons and their families and provide opportunities for
students to participate in active learning and discovery about the
problems of aging. When asked about his career decision, geriatrician
Christopher Callahan, MD, Indiana University Center for Aging Research,
cheerfully remarks, &#8220;I like the stories old people have to tell of a
life lived. I like complexity and I like the people who also chose a
career in geriatrics. They are some of the finest and most talented
people in the country. I am proud to be associated with the field.&#8221;<br />
