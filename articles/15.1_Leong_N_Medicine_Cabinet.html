Remember our parents coaxing us into taking cough medicine when we got
sick? Recently, however, cough medication has become the source of an
epidemic of teenage drug abuse and overdose. Although prolonged
publicity about overdosing on over-the-counter drugs has made the issue
almost mundane, many teenagers now feel that cough medicine is a
moderate alternative to illegal drugs. Its high availability and low
cost translate into increased legal circumvention and facilitation of
substance abuse.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially, cough medicine abuse entails ingesting
a large dosage of a dextromethorphan (DXM)-containing substance in a
very short span of time to achieve a &#8220;high.&#8221; In 1958, DXM was approved
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a safer, less addictive
alternative to codeine, its narcotic predecessor, and is currently the
active ingredient in more than 125 over-the-counter cough suppressants
found in the United States, usually labeled &#8220;DX&#8221; or &#8220;maximum strength.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a study by Jodi K. Bryner, PharmD,
University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues from other
institutions published in the December 11, 2006 issue of the Archives
of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine, DXM abuse has increased
ten-fold from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2004. Specifically, there
has been a fifteen-fold increase in the 9-17-year- old age bracket that
makes up approximately 75 percent of total reported abuse cases. This
six-year study analyzed the increasing trend in DXM abuse as reported
to the California Poison Control System and found that California&#8217;s
patterns of abuse paralleled the nationwide trends documented by the
American Association of Poison Control Centers and the Drug Abuse
Network.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the effects of DXM vary with dosage, blurring
the fine line between side effects and symptoms of an overdose, abusers
claim to experience distinct levels of the high that range from mild
stimulation or excitation with visual distortions to a sense of
complete dissociation from one&#8217;s body. Side effects include nausea,
abdominal pain, vomiting, irregular heartbeat, hypertension, headache,
and numbness. Overdose can cause paralysis of the limbs, inability to
speak, slowed or arrested breathing, permanent brain damage, cerebral
hemorrhages, and stroke.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DXM is explicitly exempt from regulation under the
Controlled Substances Act of 1970. However, the Drug Enforcement Agency
has recognized that DXM is recreationally abused as a dissociative
anesthetic similar to phencyclidine (better known as PCP) and is
therefore listed as a chemical of concern that will be considered for
possible re-evaluation. The FDA considers DXM to be a &#8220;misbranded
drug,&#8221; which means it can legally be sold without proper directions or
warnings in a variety of forms. For the time being, abusers can only be
prosecuted for disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace while under
the influence. Aside from the aforementioned detriments of DXM abuse,
the average abuser should be aware that DXM abuse and overdose can be
fatal. Despite appearing to be deceptively benign, DXM is a
neurotransmitter inhibitor that can significantly retard and even shut
down neural pathways. While this ensuing disassociation of the brain is
typically the desired effect of recreational use, it can also be a
harbinger of lethal overdose. Focus on adults should primarily be
concerned with their roles as parents; they should be aware of rampant
DXM and cough syrup abuse. The common misconception of cough syrup
being solely medicinal, as well as (continued on page 10) the fact that
it is an affordable over-the-counter consumer product, often allows
recreational abuse to go undetected until it is too late.<br />
