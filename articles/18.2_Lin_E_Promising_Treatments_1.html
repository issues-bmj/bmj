<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="diabetic cataractogenesis lens ophthalmology eye cataract surgery" src="18.2_Lin_E_Promising_Treatments.jpg.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to the World Health Organization, cataracts are the leading
cause of blindness worldwide, accounting for almost half of the cases
of blindness. Cataracts are characterized by a clouding of the lens and
are very common in the elderly. According to National Eye Institute,
more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or have had
cataract surgery by age 80.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The degree of cataract severity ranges
from slight opacity to complete obstruction of the passage of light
through the lens. The lens helps to focus light on the retina, allowing
our brain to receive electrical signals thereby producing the image
that we see. Opacities in the lens severely inhibit the visual field
and quality of life of the patient. Often times the opacity can become
so severe that the patient will choose to undergo a surgical procedure
to have the lens removed. However, these surgeries can become
problematic, especially in third world countries. In a study published
in the journal Current Opinion in Ophthalmology, Dr. Gullapalli Rao of
the LV Prasad Eye Institute found that cataract removal surgeries are
often performed by untrained professionals in unsanitary conditions,
resulting in eye infections and irreversible eye damage. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While cataracts have not made a
significant contribution to blindness in United States, the number of
patients with cataracts may begin to spike in the near future. A study
led by Dr. Irina Obrosova at Louisiana State University found that
diabetes is associated with a five-fold increase in an individual&#8217;s
chance of developing cataracts. Diabetes puts a tremendous mental and
financial strain upon both the patient and healthcare system. According
to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes-related medical expenses
cost taxpayers and patients over $217 million a year. Unfortunately,
the situation could become worse because diabetics have a much higher
risk for developing cataracts. The link between cataracts and diabetes
could quickly accelerate the magnitude of damage that cataracts have in
the United States.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to understand the mechanism for
the formation of diabetic cataracts, it should first be noted that
there is no such thing as a standard cataract. Each type of cataract is
unique and can have different ages of onset, location, and cause.
According to Dr. Catherine Cheng of the University of California,
Berkeley&#8217;s School of Optometry, cataracts can be caused by a &#8220;multitude
of factors including genetic predisposition, trauma to the eye,
inflammation, metabolic disorders, radiation damage, and drug use.&#8221; <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The uniqueness of diabetic cataracts is
due to the metabolic mechanism of the lens. The lens is composed of
avascular tissue, meaning it does not have blood vessels. Unlike other
tissues that have blood vessels, the lens relies far more on glycolysis
to produce the necessary ATP for function. Glycolysis is the metabolic
pathway that prepares glucose to be eventually converted into ATP, the
compound which supplies most of our energy.&nbsp; In most cells,
glycolysis supplies around 17% of the necessary ATP, whereas in
avascular lens cells glycolysis supplies 65% of the necessary ATP.<br />
