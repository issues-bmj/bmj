<h3 style="text-align: center;">Stem Cell Research Targets Cartilage Repair<br />
</h3><br />

<p><small><br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="stem cell cartilage repair" src="20.2_Organ_N_Cartilage_Repair.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The American population is no stranger to the symptoms of damaged
cartilage. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention,
up to 27 million Americans suffer from Osteoarthritis, a chronic
condition that causes painful inflammation of the joints and joint
damage.&nbsp; In addition to that, the Hospital for Special Surgery in
New York estimates that each year 400,000 Americans require surgery for
cartilage damage. Fortunately, the stem cell world is exploding with
promising research into tissue repair and regeneration.&nbsp; In
particular, cartilage repair has attracted substantial attention in the
last year as a target for stem cell research. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Labs around the world are engaged in
exciting projects to develop and perfect stem cell therapies that
target one of the most commonly debilitating injuries. Unlike muscle or
bone, cartilage is notoriously difficult to repair because the tissue
does not have direct blood or nerve supply. Current treatments for
cartilage damage and degradation include pain management measures and
surgery to transplant cartilage cells from another location in the
patient&#8217;s body. One of the most renowned techniques is called
autologous chondrocyte implantation, or ACI. The surgery is a
multi-step intervention that uses the patient&#8217;s own cultured cartilage
cells and transplanted membranes to trap new cartilage cells in
defective parts of a joint. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While ACI is helpful for many, it has its
share of drawbacks. Firstly, ACI cannot be performed on those with
osteoarthritis (OA). OA is an autoimmune disorder, which means that the
body is just as likely to attack the transplanted cartilage as it is
the original cartilage; transplant surgery is therefore not helpful.
Additionally, ACI transplants can take months to heal and more than a
year to reach full functionality. To narrow the pool of potential ACI
recipients even further, candidates must have otherwise healthy knees
and sound biomechanics to reduce the risk of complications after the
transplant. Clearly, options are limited for many people suffering with
cartilage-related knee and joint problems.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the end of 2012, however, Dr. Liang
Xin Tay et al. from the University of Malaya, Malaysia, published work
in The American Journal of Sports Medicine comparing ACI with a newer
method involving stem cell implants.&nbsp; Tay&#8217;s study implemented
allogenic mesenchymal stem cells, or alloMSCs. MSCs are
undifferentiated stem cells that can be extracted from umbilical cord
blood, bone marrow, and adipose tissue. The fact that they are
allogenic means that the cells are harvested from a different organism
than the one receiving the treatment.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alloMSC cells are of special interest
because they have an excellent ability to differentiate into different
types of tissues. Here, it is of primary importance that MSCs are able
to differentiate into bone cells and cartilage cells. Additionally,
alloMSC are less vulnerable to attack by the patient&#8217;s body.&nbsp;
&#8220;Mesenchymal stem cells can evade host immune system and modulate and
suppress rejection from the recipient after injection (...),&#8221; explained
Tay in an interview. &#8220;In our study,&#8221; he confirmed, &#8220;rabbits treated
with alloMSCs were not observed going through any attack or immune
response.&#8221;</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Tay&#8217;s trial was conducted on 30 white
male rabbits of similar age and weight. All of the rabbits underwent
operations to intentionally damage the cartilage in both knees. The
left knees served as controls while the right knees were randomly
assigned to one of the two treatments, either ACI or alloMSC therapy.
Stem cells were harvested from the bone marrow of 3 additional rabbits.
The autoC and alloMSC cells were encased in alginate, an algae-derived
polymer that is used to provide a structure into which the new cells
can grow.&nbsp; Six weeks after the cartilage injuries were performed,
the rabbits received implants of either autoC or alloMSC beads.&nbsp;
To secure the beads, a small flap of healthy tissue from the uninjured
side of the injured knee was sewn on top of the injury.<br />
