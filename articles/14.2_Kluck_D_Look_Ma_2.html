<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Sullivan travels to Chicago frequently to
participate in further research. When at the RIC, Sullivan uses a
cutting-edge six-motor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myoelectric prosthesis that
combines a shoulder from Scotland and a wrist developed in Germany with
a hand manufactured in China. This high-tech bionic arm is still a
prototype, and when at home, Sullivan relies on a three-motor
prosthesis. Although the arm is driven by only three motors, the fact
that it is operated by the redirected nerves in his chest muscles, as
opposed to a pair of remaining muscles, allows him to manipulate his
arm, wrist, and hand at practically the same time. Actions such as
weed-whacking or climbing a ladder that would have been significantly
more difficult, if not virtually impossible, with a conventional
prosthesis have now become commonplace for Sullivan. Eric Westover,
editor of UpperEx, a magazine devoted solely to upper extremity
amputees, and goalkeeper for the United States National Amputee Soccer
Team remarks that &#8220;there is definitely practicality in the bionic
prosthesis.&#8221; He notes that harnesses are not needed to operate the
device, unlike with a body-powered unit. Further, moving one&#8217;s arms
behind the back and above the head, which Westover contends can become
&#8220;very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve&#8221; with a body-powered
unit, is relatively easy with the new myoelectric arm. Schultz adds,
&#8220;Because the control of each degree of freedom is more natural and
because the reinnervation surgery has provided more myoelectric control
sites [&#8230;] the subject can control multiple degrees of freedom at once,
a task impossible with a conventional myoelectric prosthesis. We have
found that our patients are capable of controlling multiple degrees of
freedom with little additional effort.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sullivan&#8217;s success has recently been confirmed in
another patient, Claudia Mitchell, who lost her arm in a motorcycle
accident. Encouraged by these remarkable procedures, the Pentagon&#8217;s
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has consequently
begun research into replacement limbs for veterans. Although the
commercial market for such high-tech myoelectric arms is limited, the
recent increase in amputee soldiers has led the military to investigate
these incredible prosthetics. With the cooperation of 30 science and
industry leaders, DARPA has jump-started research into an even more
advanced bionic prosthesis, which incorporates sensory input
mechanisms, better myoelectric control and lower-limb applications that
thousands of patients could eventually use. Westover notes that &#8220;with
all the media attention on the returning veterans from the conflicts
around the world and the money that the government is investing into
this area, it has definitely sparked a technological race among
scientists, researchers, engineers, and all those involved with the
industry of prosthetics and service providers of upper extremity
amputees.&#8221; Grace C.Y. Peng, PhD, program director at the National
Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering&#8217;s Division of
Discovery Science and says, &#8220;One of the next steps is to move beyond
movement control and integrate other sensory systems into these
devices. Users depend on these devices to relieve the burden of daily
activities. Information of touch, pain, [or] temperature...will further
facilitate daily function.&#8221; Research into these areas, coupled with the
success of Sullivan and Mitchell, seems to suggest on the whole a
brighter future for amputees and a more realistic one for their
prosthetic accompaniments.</small><br />
