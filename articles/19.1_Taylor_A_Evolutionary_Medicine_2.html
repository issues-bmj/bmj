<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Evolutionary Medicine</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neuron production begins by the sixth week
of gestation, and the OSVZ arises during the eleventh week. For the
next 6 weeks, the OSVZ undergoes significant cellular expansion, and
correspondingly there is an increased growth of the neocortex. The oRG
cells also function to increase the surface area of the brain by
expanding the radial fiber scaffold necessary for neuronal migration
from the OSVZ to the neocortex. In general, the stem cells of the OSVZ
generate exceptionally more neurons, and construct a greater surface
area of the neocortex. These effects ultimately equate to a larger
brain.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Kriegstein describes, &#8220;the human brain
is highly folded, or gyrencephalic, and (...) this is because the
cortical surface is so big that in order for it to fit into a
reasonably sized skull, it involves folding on itself. So,&#8221; Kriegstein
continues,&nbsp; &#8220;it is folded, like an accordion in a way, in order to
fit into a small space. What the folding really means, is that the
brain has gotten hugely expanded, and this expansion is due to a lot
more neurons.&#8221;<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to understand differences in
neural maturation, size, and shape, research involved in the brain
development of various other animals should also include a further
exploration for OSVZ stem cells. For example, the human neocortex is
quite different from mice, which could offer limitations for scientists
modeling human brain diseases using mice specimens. &#8220;The overall goal
of this research, in part, is to teach us just how good a model the
mouse is for diseases that involve the human cortex,&#8221; Kriegstein
explains. &#8220;Now we are going back and looking again at rodents, and
discovering that they contain certain features that have not been
appreciated before.&#8221;<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The findings in Kriegstein&#8217;s lab has shown
that the complexity of the cerebral cortex is still far from being
understood, but through our advances in research, we are continuing to
grow closer to deciphering the elaborate puzzle of the human brain. The
stem cells identified dictate the biological processes underlying the
expansion of the neocortex. Between mammals, there are differences
between the properties of these cells, and this directly affects the
number of neurons they produce. These cells are further being used, and
their properties compared, to examine mammalian diversity in brain size.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this newfound understanding about
the brain&#8217;s evolution, researchers have an alternative direction to
examine modern health illnesses. Dr. Arnold Kriegstein emanates thrill
and exhilaration as he explains, &#8220;What could be more fascinating than
the human brain? It is the source of everything that makes us uniquely
human; our intelligence, our reasoning ability, our cognitive
functions, [and] our personality. All of that has to do with how the
brain works&#8230;an extremely complicated machine.&#8221;<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humans have always asked fundamental
questions about the brain. It is what gives us our similarities, our
differences), our small idiosyncrasies, and our immense beliefs. It is
what makes us, well &#8230; human. These cells provide us with a peek into
the labyrinth of the brain. Further discoveries will reveal answers
about the complexities of the brain, catapulting us towards ingenious
therapeutic advances in the future.</small><br />
