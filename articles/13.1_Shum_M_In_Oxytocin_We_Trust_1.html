<p style="text-align: center;">Controversial uses of a reproductive hormone<br />

A candidate surreptitiously mists the air, brainwashing a crowd at a
political rally. A government interrogator pries classified material
from a terrorist with a trust-inducing chemical. Unscrupulous marketers
successfully snare consumers into a department store pumped with a
mind-altering hormone. Rest assured, these bizarre conspiracies will
most likely never occur. However, recent scientific advances have
yielded a hormone-based drug that may promote trusting behavior in
humans, and further research of this substance may uncover new
treatments for patients with social phobias and other clinical
disorders.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Swiss research team has discovered &#8220;trust in a
bottle,&#8221; an experimental nasal spray containing the hormone oxytocin,
which may inhibit anxiety and promote feelings of trust among its
users. Ernst Fehr, PhD, Director of the Institute for Empirical
Research in Economics at the University of Zurich, led the study and
recently published his findings in Nature and the American Economic
Review.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oxytocin has long been considered a strictly
reproductive hormone that is present in both sexes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It works by &#8220;promoting monogamy, devotion, and selfless behavior
required to raise offspring,&#8221; says Dacher Keltner, PhD, of the
University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secretion of oxytocin by the neuroendocrine
cells of the posterior pituitary gland is controlled by the
hypothalamus, which regulates basic bodily functions such as hunger,
thirst, and body temperature. It is primarily secreted in females to
stimulate uterine contractions during childbirth and to induce
lactation. Oxytocin is also released in both men and women during sex
to facilitate mate-bonding, a mechanism Dr. Fehr describes as enabling
individuals to &#8220;overcome their natural avoidance of proximity and to
inhibit defensive behavior.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Markus Heinrichs, PhD, and Michael Kosfeld, PhD, at
the University of Zurich, worked with Dr. Fehr to examine the
hypothesis that oxytocin does indeed facilitate trust. According to
their analysis, comparing behavior in a group of subjects that received
oxytocin with a control group that received a placebo indicated that
oxytocin may provide a biological basis for trusting behavior in
humans. The study included 178 male student participants who received
either a single intranasal dose of 24 international units of oxytocin
or a placebo. In the first portion of the experiment, which
specifically tested oxytocin&#8217;s effect on trusting behavior, each
subject played the role of an investor who could lend a &#8220;trustee&#8221; up to
12 units of money equivalent to approximately 32 cents. The trustee
tripled the investor&#8217;s money but was not obligated to return any amount
of the investment.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the 29 participants who received oxytocin, 45
percent invested the maximum amount of 12 monetary units, thereby
demonstrating what Dr. Fehr termed &#8220;maximal trust.&#8221; Only 21 percent
were stingy enough to invest fewer than eight monetary units, whereas
the placebo group exhibited the antithesis of trusting behavior. Only
21 percent of the placebo participants invested all 12 units, whereas
45 percent invested at much lower levels. Overall, investors who
inhaled oxytocin invested 17 percent more than investors on the placebo.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second portion of the study examined subjects&#8217;
willingness to take risks&#8212;whether oxytocin allowed users to overcome a
general aversion to risk or if it specifically facilitated trusting
behavior in social interactions. When investors were asked to entrust
money to a computer program, no significant difference was seen between
the average amounts invested by the oxytocin and placebo groups. As a
result, Dr. Fehr and his colleagues concluded that oxytocin
&#8220;specifically affects trust in interpersonal interactions.&#8221;<br />
