<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Another interesting application of VRT is in
the area of pain reduction. In 1996, Hoffman and David Patterson, PhD,
at the department of rehabilitation medicine at the University of
Washington, co-founded the new technique of using VRT for pain control.
According to Patterson, VRT has been found to be particularly
successful in conditioning painful medical procedures such as burn
wound-dressing changes and aggressive physical therapy. As they
reported in the July 2004 issue of Scientific American, Horrman and
Patterson worked with the staff at Harborview Burn Center in Seattle,
Washington, to determine whether immersive VRT techniques could be used
to distract patients from their pain. In the study, two teenagers who
were undergoing removal of staples from skin grafts reported severe to
excruciating pain while playing Nintendo games but experienced large
reductions in pain while immersed in SpiderWorld, a virtual
environment. The study concluded that the illusion of being immersed in
the 3D virtual environment was far stronger in reducing pain perception
than the illusion of going inside a 2D video game. As Hoffman notes,
pain has a strong psychological component. When the patient is immersed
in a virtual environment, the &#8220;spotlight&#8221; of the patient&#8217;s attention
can be lured away from his pain. In this way, the patient no longer
focuses his complete attention on the pain and thus reduces the overall
amount of pain he perceives.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the latest virtual environments being used
specifically for burn patients is called SnowWorld. Developed by
Hoffman and his colleagues at the University of Washington Human
Interface Technology Lab in collaboration with Harborview Burn Center,
SnowWorld provides the illusion of flying through an icy canyon as
snowflakes fall down. The cold, snowy imagery is designed to help &#8220;put
out the fire&#8221; from the patient&#8217;s pain during burn wound care. As
patients slide through the virtual canyon, they can shoot snowballs at
snowmen, igloos, robots, and penguins in order to distract themselves.
Although this virtual environment has proven to be extremely
successful, Patterson points out that &#8220;having a whole series of worlds
that will have a broad range of appeal will be of great help,&#8221; since
most of the virtual environments currently available target patients
between the ages of 10 and 30.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VRT is becoming increasingly popular in the health
and medical settings. It has been used as a form of pain distraction
for pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. There are also
many virtual reality medical centers that provide the general public
with a variety of virtual environments specifically designed for
combating a particular phobia. The treatment costs between $100 to $300
an hour and is typically completed in eight one-hour sessions. Though
room for improvement still exists, this revolutionizing advancement in
psychological treatment finally offers an effective solution for
patients who are combating phobias, PTSD, or pain.</small><br />
