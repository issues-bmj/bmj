<p><small><br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="virtual reality vrt phobia" src="14.2_Wijegunaratne_K_Virtual_Reality.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although fear is an adaptive response to danger, serious problems can
arise when it becomes so exaggerated and unreasonable that it
interferes with one&#8217;s daily life. But today, a form of treatment known
as Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT) can help a patient combat his phobia
through exposure to a virtual environment containing the feared
stimulus. By using a platform and headset, a patient is immersed into a
computer-generated 3D environment that incorporates body tracking
devices and live digital video. Controlled by the therapist, the
sensory aspects of the virtual environment&#8212;auditory, visual, and
tactile&#8212;are delivered to the individual through the head-mounted
display. By re-enacting the feared situation, the phobia can be
confronted and hopefully conquered within the safe confines of virtual
reality.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean McKay, PhD, and his research group at Fordham
University&#8217;s department of psychology have been very successful in
using current VRT protocols to treat aviophobia, the fear of flying. In
a typical VRT session, an aviophobic patient can gaze out of the window
of a videotaped plane during take-off, making VRT a practical and
economical procedure. The set environment is replete with realistic
sights, sounds, and vibrations. McKay is currently investigating
methods to improve the effectiveness of VRT for glossophobia, the fear
of public speaking, and astraphobia, the fear of thunder and lightning.
The revolutionizing step, however, &#8220;will [be] in the realm of realistic
video resolution,&#8221; McKay believes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers are not only striving to improve VRT
technology but are also keen on formulating novel applications for it.
Judith Cukor, PhD, of the Program for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress
Disorders at Weill Cornell Medical College, is currently conducting
clinical research studies to determine the effectiveness of VRT in the
treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cukor states that
the previous standard treatment for PTSD was imaginal exposure therapy,
in which the patient describes his experience repeatedly while
attempting to &#8220;re-experience&#8221; it and feel the emotions from that day.
Unfortunately, many patients are reluctant or incapable of
self-generating these painful, emotional feelings. Additionally, Cukor
notes that &#8220;one of the symptoms of PTSD is numbing oneself, so numb
patients may be able to recite their experiences without generating any
of the emotions that they felt on that day.&#8221; VRT resolves this issue by
immersing a patient in realistic environments, thereby allowing these
emotions to resurface without forcing the patients to purposefully
recall traumatic experiences.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, Cukor&#8217;s research group is focusing on
assessing the effectiveness of treating patients with PTSD stemming
from the September 11th attacks and the ongoing war in Iraq. She
emphasizes that previous ventures into this realm have been effective.
Most notably, JoAnn Difede, PhD, at the department of psychology of New
York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College, in
collaboration with Hunter Hoffman, PhD, at the department of psychology
of the University of Washington, have already developed a virtual
environment called the &#8220;World Trade Center&#8221; to help treat September
11th-related PTSD. As described in a case report published by Difede in
the November 2002 issue of CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior, this virtual
environment was used to treat a patient who was present at the World
Trade Center attacks and suffered flashbacks, sleep problems,
hypervigilance, anger, and irritability. After putting on the
head-mount and entering the virtual world of lower Manhattan, the
patient saw the twin towers and cried for the first time. The patient
began with manageable situations, such as a plane flying past the World
Trade Center, and ended with gruesomely realistic ones such as images
of people jumping from the burning buildings and the sounds of sirens
and screams. Cukor emphasizes the importance of replaying the events in
a gradual, therapeutic manner so that the patient does not become
re-traumatized. Only after habituating to one scene can a patient move
on to a more traumatic one. This particular case report concluded that
the patient showed a large and stable reduction in her PTSD symptoms
and depression after successfully completing VRT treatment.<br />
