First impressions are everything in making or breaking a relationship.
In most cases, before the first elegant greeting to initiate
conversation or the first firm handshake, the quality of your skin is
already allowing the other person to make a critical judgment about
you. In January of 2012, Ian Stephen and his colleagues at the
University of Nottingham published an article in the journal Evolution
and Human Behavior that claims women are more attracted to men with
healthier skin than men with a masculine face.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous research by psychologist Shelley Adamo at
Dalhousie University in Canada published in the journal Animal
Behaviour shows that females seek mates based on their disease
resistance as well as their current physical condition and vigor. As a
result, by favoring fitness in men for a certain immune function or
other fitness advantage, the female may ensure that her offspring may
also benefit from such selected evolutionary advantages. In order to
find such robust men, women choose to look for male physical
attractiveness. According to Dr. Michael Cunningham of the University
of Louisville, Kentucky, women choose men who possess characteristics
that reflect sexual maturity and dominance and find such features in
the face. However, Stephen furthers research on what an indication of
good health and sexual maturity by showing through his experiment that
women find men with a golden complexion, which indicates a healthy
diet, attractive. Using photographs of both African and Caucasian men
and measuring the tone of face color by varying redness, yellowness,
and lightness, Stephen and his associates allowed women to make
critical judgments about facial attractiveness, through masculinity and
skin color, while controlling for factors, such as the phase at which
the women were on their menstrual cycle, relationship status, and their
own attractiveness. Researchers hypothesized that the women&#8217;s
preferences for a masculine facial structure would cancel out. Three
different factors varying the individual contribution of carotenoid and
melanin to the healthy yellowness of skin color were measured. In the
first study, increased yellowness and lightness of skin tone was
preferred in Caucasian and black South African faces. In the second
study, individuals with diets high in carotenoids, fruits, and
vegetables have increased yellowness of skin tone were preferred. In
the third study, increased carotenoid coloration was preferred over
increases in melanin coloration. Stephen&#8217;s results show that skin color
was a more consistent indicator of attractiveness, and men with
healthier looking &#8220;golden&#8221; skin scored highest on the attractiveness
scale. Skin color was determined to be a more important factor in
determining the scale of attractiveness than morphological masculinity.
This means that current or recent health of the individual is more
important in predicting attractiveness than past health during
development. The study was successful in connecting carotenoid
coloration to a healthy diet as an indicator of overall robustness, and
like in other animal species, such a sign of vigor is important in
determining mate choice.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephen&#8217;s research is significant to the general
population because appearance is regarded as an important aspect of
modern social interactions. With widespread marketing by a myriad of
industries, from the clothing industry to the practice of aesthetic
surgery, aiming to lure consumers with promises of improving the
appearances of an individual, such research is vital in assisting these
consumers in attaining their goals. Moreover, the highly-sought golden
skin color comes from a diet high in carotenoid pigments, such as fruit
and vegetables which further promote health and fertility. Perhaps, the
best way to maintain an attractive demeanor is simply to maintain a
steady and hearty diet supplemented with a healthy and moderate
lifestyle.<br />
