Picture this: you are about to have a lifesaving liver transplant and
the doctors tell you that they do not have enough of your blood type to
successfully complete the surgery. In an even worse scenario, they
might not have any blood of your type. According to the American Red
Cross, blood type AB is the rarest of the ABO blood groups in the
United States, since it is only found in about one percent of the
Caucasian population in the US. However, there are some blood types far
more uncommon and not classified under the typical ABO system. One such
example is type Oh (pronounced &#8220;OH&#8221;), also known as Bombay blood.
Persons with type Oh blood can only receive blood from another Oh
individual. According to the National Center for Biotechnology
Information, type Oh is found in only one in 1,000,000 Europeans and
one in 10,000 Southeast Asians, making it one of the rarest blood types
in the world.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ABO blood type system was created to indicate
what blood an individual is compatible with for a blood transfusion.
Each letter represents different antigens located on the surface of red
blood cells. If the wrong blood type is used in a transfusion, it will
lead to an acute auto-immunological reaction, in which a person&#8217;s
immune system attacks the foreign blood cells, resulting in possible
fatality. Based on the ABO system, a person with blood type O can only
receive blood from others with blood type O but can donate to any blood
type and are thus known as the universal donor. People with blood type
AB can receive any blood type but can only donate to others with blood
type AB and are known as the universal acceptor. It is generally
considered best to receive your exact blood type to minimize the
opportunity of an auto-immunological reaction. Unfortunately, the
traditional system created for blood transfusions does not work for
everybody.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People with type Oh blood do not fall under the
traditional ABO blood system. Type Oh blood is different from type O
blood because it is genetically deficient for the H antigen, a
precursor to the A and B antigens. Therefore, if a person cannot make H
antigens they cannot make either A or B antigens. If someone with Oh
blood was not tested for the presence of the H antigen, they would
appear to have blood type O, but would still have a negative reaction
to the H antigens if they were accidentally transfused with type O
blood. Thus, the only type of blood someone with type Oh can receive is
type Oh blood.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is a genetically recessive phenotype, type
Oh blood is extremely rare. According to statistics from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information, the H deficient gene occurs in
only 0.2% of the non-Southeast Asian population, so the chance that
someone has two parents with H deficient genes is quite slim.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no known adverse health effects of type Oh
blood &#8211; the only challenge someone with Oh blood faces would occur in
the case of a blood transfusion. Since the occurrence of Oh blood is
very low in western countries, there is unlikely to be any Oh blood in
the blood bank. The most likely source of Oh blood for an Oh blood
carrier would come from one&#8217;s own family, so carriers should request
that family members undergo blood type testing as a precautionary
measure.<br />
