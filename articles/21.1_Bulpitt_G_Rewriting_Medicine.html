<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="ucsf wikipedia medical students edit wiki" src="21.1_Bulpitt_G_Rewriting_Medicine.jpg.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" /></small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small>Wikipedia
is one of the most widely used sources of information in many different
subjects, including medicine and human biology. However, Wikipedia is
not usually taken as a credible source as articles can be written and
edited by anyone. But a new course at the University of California, San
Francisco (UCSF) called &#8220;Expanding WikiProject Medicine&#8221; could help
integrate detailed medical knowledge with Wikipedia&#8217;s vast
accessibility by having medical students write and edit articles for
credit.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many Wikipedia articles that are
unreliable because of a lack of references or inability on the part of
the writers to properly interpret their sources. Medical students,
though, are knowledgeable in and have access to an incredible amount of
detailed information about diseases and medications. However, a problem
that arises with these medical students is their ability to convey this
information in a way that can be understood by a wide audience. Medical
students often overuse medical jargon in conveying information because
they are used to conveying information to other students and
professors. This means that these young doctors will be unable to
clearly communicate information to patients. As a result, new doctors
must learn how to be more concise and simple in explanations to
patients from their medical training alone.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth year medical students at UCSF now
have the option of taking this course, which is a collaboration with
the nonprofit organization Wiki Project Med Foundation. The president
of this organization, James Heilman, stated that, &#8220;We know that nearly
all medical students use Wikipedia. However, we want nearly all medical
students to contribute to Wikipedia.&#8221; Medical students in the course
will be remotely editing lower quality medical articles from a
selection of about eighty Wikipedia articles while monitored by the
professors of the course.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will help vastly in the abilities of
these future doctors. According to Dr. Amin Azzam of the UCSF Medical
School and instructor of the new course, &#8220;Writing and editing Wikipedia
articles requires a similar skill set [to actual medical practice], and
teaches our students how to write for a broader audience and
communicate with patients using consumer-friendly language rather than
doctor jargon.&#8221; Over the course, students will perform substantial
research on each topic using in depth medical journal entries and other
pieces of medical literature. They will then compose and edit articles
such that they are complete, relevant, and accessible to the public.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, what &#8220;Expanding Wikiproject
Medicine&#8221; will do is help new doctors have a greater understanding of
the body by requiring extensive research into important medical topics.
This course will also provide credible information on diseases to the
public and create doctors who are more connected with our internet
based society. Dr. Azzam stated that, &#8220;We as a profession have a corpus
of knowledge, and we owe it as a profession to educate the lay public&#8221;.
By having courses such as &#8220;Expanding WikiProject Medicine&#8221;, there
should also hopefully be an improvement in new doctors&#8217; ability to
communicate with patients in a way that is both accurate and
understandable.<br />
