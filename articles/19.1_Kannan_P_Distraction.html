Have you ever had trouble concentrating? Constantly feel frustrated or
distracted? These are symptoms faced by 3-5% of American children and
adults that fight Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, commonly
known as ADHD. Adults and children dealing with this neurological
disorder experience problems at work, in school and in their personal
lives. In particular, children with ADHD are extremely restless in the
classroom.&nbsp; ADHD has been linked with reading disabilities,
schizophrenia, and even bipolar disorder.&nbsp; The most prominent
symptom of ADHD in adults is difficulty planning and organizing. The
condition is treated with a combination of behavioral and medicinal
therapy, but in some cases the approach fails to yield positive
results. For these patients, unsuccessful treatment may be attributed
to a certain genetic predisposition to ADHD that cannot be medicated.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gene associated with ADHD is referred
to as DAT1. The DAT1 gene is responsible for regulating dopamine
transmission between brain cells. The gene comes in two forms, DAT1 10
and DAT1 9. People who have two copies of DAT1 10-- one each from his
or her mother and father-- are known to be at greater risk for
developing ADHD.&nbsp; Having two alleles of DAT1 10 is correlated with
lower levels of dopamine receptors in the brain. This is important
because dopamine is most important as a gateway for information,
allowing or repelling the influx of information. Those patients that
were 10/10 carriers did not perform well in preventing their mind
wandering regions from affecting and interplaying with memory
performance regions. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New research conducted by Dr. Nigel
Williams of Cardiff University also shows that in addition to
possessing DAT1 10 alleles, children with ADHD are more likely to have
small segments of their DNA duplicated or missing. Strikingly, there is
an overlap between copy number variations found in certain segments of
the genome in children with ADHD and children with schizophrenia or
autism. The most significant similarities occur on chromosome 16, a
chromosome involved in many other serious psychological conditions.
Thus, the statement that ADHD is genetic is not beyond the scope of
reason. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How, then, do current drugs treat ADHD? A
study released by the National Institute of Health in August 2011
explains. To start, people have one of three dopamine receptors in the
brain. One of the possible receptors, however, does not sufficiently
reduce the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Excess glutamate
is a cause of impulsive behavior and other symptoms of ADHD.
Psychostimulants, the class of drugs commonly used to treat ADHD, work
with dopamine receptors to reduce glutamate release-- but only in those
with the proper dopamine receptors. This was the first study to show
how this particular genetic difference might translate into varied
success with drug treatment. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does this mean for the future of
patients suffering from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder? Among
children with ADHD, 66.3% are treated with medication. The eventual
goal behind the Society of Neuroscience is to narrow down the function
behind all the candidate genes. The research conducted in addition by
the National Institute of Drug Abuse has concluded that many of the
adults and children who have the condition are not genetically capable
of being cured by the psychostimulants they are being prescribed. While
Dr. Nigel Williams&#8217;s lab hopes to find the links between ADHD and other
genetic neurobehavioral disorders, it is important for researchers in
the future to keep in mind that external factors influence development
of ADHD. Hopefully one day, scientists will be able to use this new
information to change the lives of many children around the world.<br />
