<p style="text-align: center;">Does bottled water tap out?<br />
</p>

<p><small><br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="bottle water tap purity pure" src="13.1_Lee_Y_Danger_In_A_Bottle.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As Americans, we are fortunate enough to live in a country in which
clean, drinkable tap water is readily available and bottled water is
offered as a fancier alternative. Recently, the use of bottled water in
our country has become so widespread that it is often considered more
of a necessity than a luxury. This growing trend is largely due to the
commonly held misconception that bottled water is healthier and more
pure than water that comes from the tap.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a poll taken among college students&#8212;a group
highly prone to bottled water usage&#8212;a whopping 73 percent rated water
quality as their number one reason for choosing bottled water over tap
water. The issue of convenience ranked a distant second, followed by
taste. More and more people are choosing bottled water because they
believe it is cleaner or because it does not taste of chlorine.
Moreover, in countries like America, in which water purity is not as
much of a concern, the consumption of bottled water is no longer just
an issue of safety or taste--it is becoming a way of life.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &#8220;purity hype&#8221; surrounding bottled water is
merely a marketing gimmick, albeit a successful one. The bottled water
industry has experienced the largest growth out of all beverage
industries, including the alcohol industry. Bottled water marketers
create the illusion that bottled water is purer than water from the
tap, yet 25 percent of bottled water has been shown to be nothing more
than tap water. Just last year, the Food Standard Agency in Britain
investigated the Coca-Cola company after authorities discovered that
the source of Dasani had actually been London tap water. Pepsi,
Coca-Cola&#8217;s leading competitor, sells the single most popular brand of
bottled water in America, Aquafina. Contrary to what the label&#8217;s
soothing pictures of mountain springs may suggest, however, Pepsi also
bottles its water not from remote mountain ranges, but from the tap.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite what most people believe, the quality of
bottled water is not even on par with that of tap water. In America,
bottled water is regulated just as any other packaged food product,
making bottled water less rigorously regulated than water supplied by
the city. For example, the city water system tests for Fecal coliform
bacteria--bacteria found in human and animal feces--several times a day
whereas a bottling plant conducts this test only once a week.
Furthermore, nearly 70 percent of bottled water sold in the nation is
not subject to U.S. regulations because the regulations apply only to
bottled water sold over state lines. While none of the nation&#8217;s major
bottled water corporations were available for questions, General
Manager Andrew Mooradian of Monadnock Mountain Spring Water states that
his company &#8220;tests daily for bacteria and once a week have an outside
state-certified lab test.&#8221; Mooradian also insists that since bottled
water is an alternative to tap water, it does not compete with public
water supplies. Nonetheless, &#8220;the benefit of bottled water,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;is that it is consistent.&#8221; Currently, no shelf life for bottled water
has been set by the FDA. &#8220;There is no law in place, but the industry
standard is two years,&#8221; says Mooradian.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a study done at the Department of
Microbiology at Punjab Agriculture University in Ludhiana, India, nine
out of nine randomly chosen bottles of water&#8212;each from a different
brand such as Aquafina, Fresh &#8216;n Cool, and Spring- well&#8212;were evaluated
to be unfit for human consumption. In the study, all brands tested
positive for bacteria which should not have been present, including <span style="font-style: italic;">Salmonella</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Pseudomonas</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">aeruginosa</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Clostridium</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">perfringens</span>. Four brands tested positive for <span style="font-style: italic;">Escherichia</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">coli</span>, while all brands except Aquafina tested positive for <span style="font-style: italic;">Fecal</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">coliform</span>.<br />
