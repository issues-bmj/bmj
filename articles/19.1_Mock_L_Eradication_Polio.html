<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Coming Eradication of Polio<br />
</h3>
<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">Lauren Mock<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">Fall 2011<br />

<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="" src="19.1_Mock_L_Eradication_Polio.jpg.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So long ago, over 20
years, was the last
case of indigenous <span style="font-style: italic;">poliomyelitis</span>
(polio) reported in the Americas that
few remember the specter of iron lungs, crutches, and death from this
highly virulent disease, or the emotional relief with news of the
development of vaccines by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Polio is a contagious viral disease that frequently
targets children less than five years of age. It attacks the nervous
system and often cripples or kills the afflicted. Many people who are
carriers of the disease exhibit no symptoms and silently infect others.
Polio spreads rapidly in areas with poor sanitation; insects can
passively transfer the virus from feces to food. Though efforts of
government and organizations like the March of Dimes and the Rotary
have successfully eradicated the disease from North America, the
specter of this disease remains.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The California Department of Public Health
announced, as of October 10, 2011, that 44 suspected and confirmed
cases of another viral disease, <span style="font-style: italic;">parotitis</span>
(mumps), have infected
students at the University of California at Berkeley. The disease broke
out locally when one student contracted the disease in Great Britain,
and upon returning to the campus, passed the virus to others in the
residential housing system and from those infected to others throughout
the campus. Lines grew around the block of the Tang Student Health
center as students sought protective vaccinations. It only took one
student to ignite the outbreak.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This recent importation and outbreak illustrate that
in today&#8217;s global village, the possibility of a single carrier of a
deadly disease among any community is not as remote as people would
like to think. Consequently, with polio so insidious in its incubation
and virulent in its communicability, the World Health Organization
(WHO) considers even a single case of polio paralysis to be evidence of
an epidemic in areas where polio has been eliminated.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no cure for polio; yet, polio is ripe for
eradication. Polio can only survive a short time in the environment,
has no virus reservoir in animals, and affects only people. Moreover,
safe, effective, and inexpensive vaccines, given in multiple doses,
provide life-long immunity. Thus, the eradication strategy is to
prevent further infection by immunizing sufficient numbers of children,
making them unsusceptible to the disease, and effectively ending the
cycle of infectious transmission.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, progress towards eradication has been
successful. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative reported that in
1988 when coordinated eradication efforts began, polio paralyzed more
than 1000 children worldwide every day. Since then, 2.5 billion
children have been immunized against polio. As late as 2009, fewer than
2000 cases were reported for the entire year, and that number has been
falling rapidly.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, polio remains an epidemic in nations like
Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan, with several countries across
Africa and Asia experiencing ongoing outbreaks or re-established
transmission of polio virus from importations. Because of costs, some
policymakers have argued for a strategy of effective control, rather
than the complete eradication of polio. However economic modeling
studies from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative have demonstrated
that beyond fundamental humanitarian benefits, eradication is not only
cost-effective, but also offers critical monetary savings that accrue
to low-income countries.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasional setbacks remain. WHO reported that in
2009-2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to
imports of the virus. Even the European Region suffered its first
importation of polio in 2010, after already having received polio
free-certification.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, eradication of polio remains within
tantalizing reach. With
continued efforts and sufficient funding, polio may someday join
smallpox which with the efforts of WHO and worldwide organizations was
successfully eradicated and relegated to laboratory stock in 1980.</small><br />
