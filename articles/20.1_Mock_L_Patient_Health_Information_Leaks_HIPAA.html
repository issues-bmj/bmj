<h3 style="text-align: center;">When Patient Health Information Leaks<br />
</h3>
<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">Lauren Mock<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">Fall 2012<br />

<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 179px;" alt="" src="20.1_Mock_L_Patient_Health_Information_Leaks_HIPAA.jpg.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than
the necessity to complete
administrative forms, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) has generally been invisible to consumers of
health services, although healthcare workers may suffer from the
bureaucracy and policies needed to comply with its provisions. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HIPAA was passed by Congress and signed into law by
President Bill Clinton in 1996. Among its provisions, the act
comprehensively and uniformly safeguards patient privacy and upholds
security of patient information. Eight years later, the first
conviction for a HIPAA privacy violation occurred in an identity theft
case, when in 2004, a Seattle Cancer Care Alliance employee used
patient information to fraudulently obtain credit cards. Still, HIPAA
would remain an esoteric acronym until the exposure of private
information of several well-known celebrities.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public and media awakened to HIPAA when in 2005,
employees at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center and Orthopedic Hospital
were "caught prying into records&#8221; of pop music star Britney Spears
after her maternity stay. Another hospitalization in 2008 again tempted
employees to access Spears' non-psychiatric medical records. Other
revelations included violations of patient data concerning television
star Farrah Fawcett, the former California first lady Maria Shriver,
and dozens of other patients.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though some violations of HIPAA are maliciously
willful, much leakage of private information is accidental. The wide
range of communications available to parties throughout various
healthcare entities exposes significant risks. Familiar sources of
information leakage may include exposed documents on desks, uncollected
output from fax machines and printers, improperly disposed documents,
or a lost laptop or USB memory card or stick. With the popularity of
social networking, the potential for HIPAA violations is magnified
through personal blogs of healthcare workers or information posted in
Facebook or other social networking sites. Even an activity as mundane
as discussing in public areas information regarding a patient may
represent a significant source of information leakage.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the original HIPAA civil penalties were
relatively small, the more recent Health Information Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted as part of the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 upped civil penalties to
$50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $1.5 million.&nbsp;
Further, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also clarified in 2005
that violators can be held criminally liable, in extreme cases with
imprisonment for up to ten years.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following two separate complaints filed by two
celebrity patients against the UCLA Health System (UCLAHS), the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights
(OCR), finally entered into a resolution agreement with UCLAHS, fining
the organization $865,500 and securing their agreement for corrective
action to fix "gaps in its compliance" with HIPAA's privacy and
security rules.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Obama administration, the HHS and OCR have
become more active in its pursuit of HIPAA violation complaints. This
past February, the OCR fined Cignet Health $4.3 million in civil
penalties for numerous violations including its inability to provide
patient records within 60 days to patients who requested them, and its
failure to cooperate with the subsequent investigation. The Obama
administration announced this as the largest fine for a violation under
HIPAA.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Escalating penalties have not yet stemmed the tide
of information breaches. Just this September, TRICARE, the Defense
Department&#8217;s healthcare program recently reported possibly the largest
health information breach in HIPAA history with 4.9 million San Antonio
area military hospital and clinic patients impacted by the loss of data
on backup tapes. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although more violations will be exposed through
audits and elevated scrutiny, healthcare organizations have been
training employees on proper information handling and investing in
procedures and technologies to secure information and communications.
Through growing public and industry awareness, security of patient
information and safeguarding of patient privacy continues to improve in
compliance with HIPAA.</small></p>
