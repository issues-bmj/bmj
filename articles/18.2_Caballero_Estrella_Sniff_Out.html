<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="sniff love mhc hla histocompatibility leukocyte" src="18.2_Caballero_Estrella_Sniff_Out.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is it possible for a woman to sniff out her soul-mate? Well, maybe not
exactly her soul-mate but a potential father. Biologically speaking, it
is not always about the striking good looks, or the
tall-dark-and-handsome type that will determine who will be a female&#8217;s
preferred mate. Using Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC), females
mechanistically look for what is &#8220;on the inside&#8221; all the way down to
their genes. MHCs help women in the evolutionary quest to find more
genetic variability for their progeny.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MHCs are a group of molecules that help
the immune system distinguish between harmful and safe foreign
substances in the body. An MHC consists of a large cluster of genes,
human leukocyte antigens (HLA), located on the short arm of chromosome
6. MHCs also contain genes that determine the structure of HLA
molecules which ultimately influence human body odor and odor
preference. In this case specifically, HLAs control a man&#8217;s body odor
and a female&#8217;s body odor preference for a potential mate.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While MHCs and pheromones work in
conjunction with each other, they are different. Pheromones interact
with the vomeronasal organ that lies between the nose and the mouth,
which processes scent signals. Pheromones act as emotional stimuli and
carry markers that help identify MHCs. The MHC influences both body
odors and body odor preference in human females. This is thought to
ensure the production of genetically diverse offspring and prevent
inbreeding.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research on female selectivity might prove
how females specifically affect natural selection through their mate
preference. They do this by choosing certain scents that are associated
with a specific genetic make-up that is identified in a person&#8217;s MHC.
In an individual, there are multiple MHC molecules which present a wide
variety of short proteins. For example, in an epidemic MHC diverse
individuals will be more likely to possess the adequate proteins to
initiate an immune response, and survive the infection. In this way,
MHC diversity provides long-term protection of a population or species.
Through this biological underpinning, women seek diverse MHCs to ensure
that their offspring are genetically fit. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers at the University of Bern in
Switzerland conducted a study concerning this phenomenon, discovering
that females actually choose their genetically preferred mate based
upon their scent. In this study, subjects were categorized by their
HLAs, &#8211;AB and &#8211;DR, which are antigens found in human cells that make up
MHCs that help the immune system identify its own cells from foreign
cells. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the study, researchers collected MHC
types among both males and females. They accounted for females who were
on the contraceptive pill as the steroid imitating pregnancy could be a
confounding factor. They gave each male an untreated cot ton t-shirt
and asked them to wear it from Sunday to Monday avoiding deodorant,
perfume, a specific list of odor producing foods, smelly rooms, and
sexual activity. They also required them to sleep alone and were given
a special unscented soap bar and laundry detergent. On Monday, the
females in the study were asked to smell and rate six of the worn
t-shirts.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women were given three t-shirts that
were similar to them according to their MHC and three t-shirts that
were dissimilar to them in their MHC. The women did not know which was
which. The study discovered that women who were not taking the
contraceptive pill found the scent that was most dissimilar to their
own MHC most attractive. Odors of the MHC-dissimilar men reminded the
females of their own mate or ex-mate twice as often as those with
similar MHC. Unexpectedly, women who were on the contraceptive pill
found the scent that was most similar to their own MHC most
attractive.&nbsp; <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results of this study found that a
woman&#8217;s preference changes in accordance with her hormonal status. The
study suggested that MHC influences mate choice according to the body
odor emitted by the male. The females on the contraceptive pill were
more attracted to the t-shirts that presented a similar MHC to their
own since the contraceptive pill simulates pregnancy hormones;
therefore the female prefers to be near people to whom she is
genetically related. This is why she finds the similar MHC scents
attractive; she identifies their MHCs as being relatives.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These studies have also been conducted in
mice, birds, and insects and have come to similar conclusions. Animals
are more attracted to the opposite sex when they smell a different MHC
combination than their own through the pheromones that are being
emitted. MHCs have also been thought of as aiding animals to avoid
inbreeding which leads to more genetic diversity. More genetic
diversity in turn gives offspring a better chance of surviving certain
illnesses.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though this study provides evidence
supporting the argument that MHCs influence mate choice, there is still
much to be researched in this area. In addition, there are factors such
as culture and religion that influence mate choice. It is fascinating
to know that humans are subconsciously looking for more than what is
perceived on the outside. Biological nature drives these mechanisms to
ensure that our genes are carried on. The complexity of nature
unraveled is absolutely remarkable, especially when it comes to
understanding how we can potentially choose our prospective mates
through the scent they emit.<br />
