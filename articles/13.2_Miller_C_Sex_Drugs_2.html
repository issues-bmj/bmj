<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; The implications of this study are far-reaching
and thought-provoking. Addiction to fentanyl is not something to be
taken lightly. Nearly a hundred times more potent than morphine,
fentanyl causes euphoria and impaired concentration upon initial use.
After several uses, the side-e&#64256;ects can become life-threatening as the
cardiovascular and pulmonary systems become compromised. As
demonstrated in a 1990 study conducted by a team of anesthesiologists
at the Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam in Houston, Texas, opioid
abuse can lead to death in almost 18 percent of addicts. Joe Stirt, MD,
an anesthesiologist at Richmond Community Hospital, explains, &#8220;In at
least two of my former residents&#8212;one from when I was on the faculty at
UCLA, and the other from my days at the University of
Virginia&#8212;addiction led to their deaths. I know personally of other
anesthesiologists whose dead bodies were discovered in call rooms or
bathrooms in the hospital with narcotics, needles, and syringes
scattered in the vicinity.&#8221; Patients may now have to worry about not
only the outcome of their procedure, but also the possibility that
their surgeon is an opiate addict.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the country, physician-help groups have begun
to address this issue of patient safety as well as the concern for
physician con&#64257;dentiality. McAuli&#64256;e notes that, overall, more than 90
percent of physicians who get help recover from addiction. However, the
majority of treatment centers have yet to come across physicians who
have become addicted by second-hand exposure. Kara Miller, the
Assistant Clinical Director of Meditox Opiate Recovery Program,
remarks, &#8220;We have seen thousands of cases of addiction to opiates,
especially fentanyl, but never have I heard of any medical
professionals such as surgeons or anesthesiologist becoming addicted to
an opiate through second-hand exposure.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of physicians seeking help for second-hand
exposure to opiates raises several important issues. Are physicians
simply refusing to acknowledge that a serious problem is developing, or
is second-hand exposure an anomalous route of addiction? While more
studies are sure to investigate this matter further, one thing is
clear: opiates and other potentially hazardous substances need to be
removed from the air of operating rooms more e&#64259;ciently. After all, for
high-risk procedures such as surgery, nothing can be allowed to
compromise the operator&#8217;s precision, judgment, and concentration.<br />
