<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Attention All Scientists!</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980,
which encouraged the patenting of university discoveries, universities
have increased patenting activity substantially. David Mowery, PhD, and
associates state in a 2001 article published in Research Policy that,
from 1970 to 2001, the number of U.S. patents issued annually to U.S.
academic institutions has increased ten-fold. These intellectual
property rights give universities a lot of power in determining to whom
their products are sold or licensed to. According to Lita Nelson,
director of the Technology Licensing O&#64259;ce at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, in her 1998 article appearing in Science,
universities often grant exclusive licenses to &#64257;rst-world
pharmaceutical companies to provide incentives for companies to develop
the products. Unfortunately, by enforcing these patents in LMI
countries, the pharmaceutical companies may prevent local and generic
companies from producing and selling these drugs at a&#64256;ordable prices.
If universities took steps such as including equitable access
provisions that allow for generic competition in developing countries,
they could help increase access to essential medicines for those who
could otherwise not a&#64256;ord then.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, universities have already taken steps to
ensure that their patents do not contribute to this access gap. A
telling example is Artemisinin, an anti-malarial drug. Malaria kills
between one and three million people annually and is becoming
increasingly resistant to &#64257;rst-line drug therapies. However, it has
been shown that combination drugs containing Artemisinin derivatives
are almost completely e&#64256;ective against the Plasmodium parasite that
causes malaria. Still, at the cost of $2.40 per adult course, these
drugs are out of reach for most people in LMI countries.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the help of a $42.6 million grant from the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation, the University of California, Berkeley
(UC Berkeley) has joined forces with Amyris Biotechnologies, Inc., and
the Institute for OneWorld Health to help reduce the cost of
Artemisinin. This public-private partnership will proceed through four
steps. First, Jay Keasling, PhD, a professor of Chemical Engineering at
UC Berkeley, will attempt to perfect a method that uses bacteria to
synthesize a cheaper version of the plant-based compounds. Second,
Amyris will engineer a process to grow and harvest the compound
e&#64259;ciently on a commercial scale. Third, the Institute for OneWorld
Health will oversee the necessary clinical trials in order to obtain
approval by the FDA. Finally, the Institute for OneWorld Health will
make the compound available to drug-makers at costs much lower than
currently possible. Collaborations such as this one allow the
university to ensure that access to essential medicines for neglected
diseases may become more widespread in the future.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admittedly, however, plans like these are not
without their skeptics&#8212;universities might not be willing to participate
in such a program. But malaria, sleeping sickness, dengue fever, and
other debilitating diseases a&#64260;icting much of the world&#8217;s population
should no longer be ignored. If there is clearly an economical means of
ensuring access to essential medicines for everyone, is it not time to
spend our resources on diseases that are crippling the rest of the
world?&nbsp; Universities have the power to raise awareness and e&#64256;ect
change. Engaging in a wide variety of biomedical research projects may
drastically improve the living standards of people in LMI countries.<br />
