<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">The growing trend of transplant tourism</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Geraldine Leung<br />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Spring 2006<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="surgery transplant tourism" src="13.2_Leung_G_Fun_Sun.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The notion of tourism conjures up images of exotic locations, fun in
the sun, and escape from the banalities of everyday life. However, a
recent trend indicates tourists may have found a new reason to travel:
readily available surgical procedures. On the positive side, many
people are combining their vacations with health care, pursuing common
medical procedures such as cosmetic surgeries, cardiovascular bypasses,
and hip replacements. Regardless, a much more sinister drive for
medical tourism exists &#8211; transplant tourism.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As &#64257;nding an organ donor becomes increasingly
di&#64259;cult in the United States (U.S.), desperate patients are turning to
the organ black market in other countries. Wealthy patients have the
option of traveling to foreign countries to receive organs harvested
from paid donors, allowing the organ recipients to cut corners and
shorten their wait period. Consequently, transplant tourism provides an
advantage to those who are &#64257;nancially well-o&#64256;.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the U.S., patients in need of an organ transplant
face the grim reality of organ shortages. According to the United
Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), in 2002, more than six thousand
patients died while waiting for a matching donor. Moreover, a new
patient is added to the UNOS list every fourteen minutes. Harish
Mahanty, MD, a transplant surgeon at the California Paci&#64257;c Medical
Center, explains that there are &#8220;17,000 patients on the waitlist for a
liver transplant, but only 4,000 surgeries are performed a year.&#8221; The
waiting period is dependent upon an individual&#8217;s Meld score, a
numerical assignment representing the patient&#8217;s need for surgery. For a
patient with blood type O and a high Meld score, the wait usually lasts
up to one year. Patients with a lower Meld score may never receive
surgery. For kidney transplants, Mahanty states that &#8220;it is pure
waiting time and may last up to &#64257;ve years.&#8221; As patients grow tired of
waiting, some venture into the organ black market for a quick solution
to their medical dilemma.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organ black market is a growing industry that
partakes in the tra&#64259;cking of harvested organs, a practice that is
illegal in the U.S. but di&#64259;cult to regulate globally. The invention of
cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant, has spurred the popularity of the
organ black market because patients no longer require exact matches to
their donors&#8217; genetic haplotypes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transplant tourism involves the transplantation of
an organ from a donor residing in a developing nation to a relatively
wealthy recipient who has traveled to the donor&#8217;s country for surgery.
Donors are willing to sell an organ for a multitude of reasons: to pay
o&#64256; debts, deal with a sudden familial health crisis, or provide for
their households. Lawrence Cohen, PhD, professor of anthropology at the
University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), quips, &#8220;People will
go to China to get a kidney from an executed prisoner, and the hospital
will be next to the execution site.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the substantial &#64257;nancial
considerations at play in the realm of transplant tourism, the safety
of both patients during and after the surgery is debatable. Mahanty
believes that it is risky to turn to transplant centers that are not
reputable, as black market surgeries do not guarantee that licensed
doctors and nurses perform the operation. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, PhD,
professor of medical anthropology at UC Berkeley, comments that donors
may be &#8220;slam-dunked&#8221; onto the operating bed. Health complications can
arise if the donor and the recipient are not provided with adequate
post-operative care. In truth, donors often do not receive any further
treatment after the procedure is complete and often are stigmatized as
&#8220;organ prostitutes,&#8221; as Scheper-Hughes remarks. Recipients may also not
receive an adequate dosage of immunosuppressant medication. Such sloppy
medical practices would not be tolerated in the U.S. As Mahanty notes,
&#8220;It is the post-op care where the care is really at. In the U.S.,
ethically, we are obligated to care for [patients].&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from the purely clinical problems that arise
from transplant tourism, the interplay between wealthy organ recipients
and poor donors sets the stage for profound socio-economic
consequences. As Scheper-Hughes notes in her article &#8220;Keeping an Eye on
the Global Tra&#64259;c in Human Organs,&#8221; which appeared in the May 2003 issue
of the Lancet, the organ black market is a locus at which the
&#8220;circulation of mortally sick bodies travel in one direction and
healthy organ in another.&#8221; In this sense, the organ black market allows
the rich to exploit the poor. Cohen explains that donors living in
poverty sell their organs due to &#64257;nancial di&#64259;culties, but selling
organs can actually whirl them into a more vicious cycle of debt. Since
most donors are already deeply in debt, the compensation for their
organs will go directly towards repaying their debts. Cohen emphasizes
that many donors discover themselves unable to perform the hard labor
that they were capable of doing before the operation. As a result, the
donors tend to fall back into debt, without the ability to ever repay
it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Mahanty admits that he, too, has
dealt with patients who have considered traveling abroad for organ
transplants. As new studies are being conducted, researchers will
hopefully glean more information about the medical and socio- economic
repercussions of this exchange. While the best way to curtail
transplant tourism would entail increasing the availability of organs
within developed nations, it does not appear as if any current measures
will be able to accomplish this in the near future. As Mahanty warily
concedes, &#8220;The waiting time is getting longer because we don&#8217;t have
enough organs [...] We are trying to utilize every organ that is
procured in the right patient.&#8221;<br />
