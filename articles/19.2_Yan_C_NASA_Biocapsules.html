For many diabetics, the idea of constantly administering shots is the
largest hassle of their treatment. The daily injection of insulin is a
necessary part of their lives, but the annoyances that come with having
the disease, such as remembering to bring insulin supplements and
constantly monitoring blood sugar levels are an extreme inconvenience
to the patient.&nbsp; Furthermore, the cost associated with treating
diabetic patients is relatively high, costing around $174 billion in
2007 according to the American Diabetics Association. The high costs
are caused by the manner in which treatment is given to patients. Blood
sugar monitors, pills, and shots all have to be constantly given to a
patient, which results in an effective, but costly treatment plan.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with a new discovery from NASA, there is a
unique and fascinating solution to this problem. Currently being
developed by Dr. David Loftus, the NASA biocapsule is an indestructible
carbon nanotube that stores and administers treatment based on the
varying concentrations of cells in the body, maintaining homeostasis in
the body. The nanotube was created to aid astronauts who are unable to
receive treatment for radiation sickness at the International Space
Station. If the invention is approved for use by NASA, the nanotube
will house a hormone called G-CSF (Granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor) to treat the effects of radiation in an astronaut's body. The
G-CSF hormone is already used on earth to treat cancer patients that
are suffering from radiation sickness.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The biocapsules are composed of a carbon polymer
that is nontoxic and &#8220;indestructible&#8221; even in the harsh environments of
space. The release of a protein or drug is controlled by a &#8220;protein
cap&#8221; that unfolds or folds based on the amount of protein that attaches
to it, allowing the drug to be administered. For example, in diabetes,
the cap would unfold or contract based on the amount of insulin or
glucose in the bloodstream. The cap would contain a receptor to which
the the insulin or glucose would bind. The cap would possibly contain
insulin supplements that would be released when glucose in the body has
been bound to it. The capsule's receptor could be tailored to the
disease it is trying to treat. For example, in diabetes, it would be
fitted with a receptor structure to which insulin could bind. In
addition, the fact that these caps are not permeable means that they
can be removed from the human body without serious harm if the capsule
needs to be altered. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Loftus's invention has already been patented and
is currently being tested on lab mice for any malfunctions or problems
with the device. According to Dr. Loftus, a few safety issues still
need to be resolved that deal specifically with the capsule's inability
to be denatured by enzymes found in the body. Since the nanotube is
indestructible, the cells it releases can have reign over a patient&#8217;s
bloodstream, causing problems with the immune system if the &#8220;protein
cap&#8221; release system is not properly controlled. The protein cap can be
denatured through high temperatures or attack by chemical compounds.
This can be a serious problem as a denatured protein loses its original
function. In the case of the protein cap no longer acting as control
mechanism for the nanotube, dangerous amounts of chemicals can be
released.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At its core level, this is an alternative delivery
system for antibiotics. While this might not seem any different from a
regular pill, the biocapsule allows for healthy cells to be
administered in a patient's body that can eventually cure the disease.
This could revolutionize the ability for the body to heal and change
the manner in which drugs are administered. Now instead of taking shots
and pills constantly, this one pill can supply a constant stream of
antibiotics based on the state of the body.&nbsp; The advantages are
obvious. These biocapsules are a form of constant drug administration
that removes the inconveniences and dangers of over the counter drugs.<br />
