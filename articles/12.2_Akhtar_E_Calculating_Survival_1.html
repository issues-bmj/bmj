<h3 style="text-align: center;">Calculating the Survival Rate<br />

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="icu treatment apache acute physiological chronic health evaluation" src="12.2_Akhtar_E_Calculating_Survival.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In order to more effectively use Intensive Care Unit (ICU) resources,
hospitals all around the country are slowly beginning to introduce a
newly developed machine that uses a series of calculations to provide a
scoring system that predicts patients&#8217; chances of survival.
Critics&#8212;patient, doctor, or otherwise&#8212; argue that, when the stakes are
as high as human life, making the right call in terms of deciding
treatment should be about anything but keeping score.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation
III (APACHE III), the most widespread of these systems, takes into
consideration a number of factors: the patient&#8217;s diagnosis and
abnormalities upon being admitted to the ICU, age, and pre-existing
medical conditions. By making use of a number of complicated algorithms
that place different weights on these various factors, the computer
assigns a score to each patient, indicating his predicted mortality
rate.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William A. Knaus, M.D., the designer of APACHE III,
has been working on these systems since 1978. When he created APACHE,
&#8220;it was very clear [that] the amount of information that came into the
ICU on a daily basis was far more than any individual could organize
and interpret correctly.&#8221; In response to this issue, physicians created
the first APACHE system, which had a doctor assign certain symptoms of
the patient on a mathematical scale. APACHE III, the most recent of
this series of systems, is the first to become fully digitalized,
measuring the factors entered as inputs and releasing its own output.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The algorithms used to create this output are
fine-tuned by being tested against an information database that
constitutes the heart of the machine&#8217;s ability to make predictions.
Millions of past patients&#8217; diagnoses and symptoms coupled with their
survival rates before and after ICU discharge are stored in the memory
of APACHE III. The computer compares the conditions of current patients
against this database in order to make its predictions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While numerous studies have been released praising
the accuracy of the machine&#8217;s work, several have also been released
that express that the tool must be used with caution. A study done by
the Mayo Clinic, a non-profit organization based in Rochester,
Minnesota, found that the computer machine was five times more
pessimistic regarding outcomes for a group of patients than the
observed outcomes. Furthermore, the study found that the physician&#8217;s
personal consideration of the patient&#8217;s health was significantly more
accurate than any outcome predicted by APACHE III.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patient attitudes reflect a similar distrust for
these machines. Patients do not want to put their lives in the hands of
a machine and prefer the compassion and humanity that goes with a
doctor&#8217;s diagnosis. Zain Yahya, a college student who has visited the
emergency room twice, expresses a similar sentiment: &#8220;They take in
other factors that can&#8217;t be put in [a machine] statistically, for
example, the will of the patient. They can get a sense of the attitude
of the patient and other immeasurable qualities&#8230; part of the stuff that
makes every patient&#8217;s situation truly unique, whereas a machine could
never do that.&#8221; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This hesitance towards accepting the machine is due
largely to the nature of APACHE&#8217;s purpose: it predicts mortality rates
and can be used to determine how ICU resources are allocated. Both
these aspects involve the higher levels of medical care that focus on
the most critical patients admitted to hospitals. Thus, APACHE occupies
one of the most critical jobs of patient care, one where the public
expects the margin of error to be as small as possible.<br />
