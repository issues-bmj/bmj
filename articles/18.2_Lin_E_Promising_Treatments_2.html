<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from A Healing Vision<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the lens cells rely so heavily on
glycolysis for energy, high blood glucose levels causes the lens cells
to uptake more glucose. Once in the lens cells, the glucose is
converted into an intermediate sugar known as sorbitol.&nbsp; From
there, sorbitol is converted into another sugar called fructose by the
polyol dehydrogenase enzyme. Problems arise when polyol dehydrogenase
becomes saturated at relatively low sorbitol levels. This means that
the polyol dehydrogenase converts sorbitol into fructose at a much
slower rate than the sorbitol is produced, creating an abundance of
sorbitol in the lens.&nbsp; The excess sorbitol increases osmotic
pressure, causing the uptake of water into the lens cells. The lens
fiber cells then begin to swell, causing light to scatter and cataracts
to form. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently there is no effective means of
reducing opacity in the lens, and surgical extraction and replacement
of the lens is the sole method available to physicians for treating
cataracts. The procedure involves first making an incision in the sac
that contains the lens, known as the lens capsule. Then the surgeon
performs a phacoemulsification, where he or she uses an ultrasonic hand
piece to liquefy the lens and vacuum it out of the eye with a miniature
vacuum. The doctor finishes by inserting a plastic intraocular lens
back into the lens capsule. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the prevalence of lens removal
surgeries, there are some disadvantages. The main disadvantage of lens
removal surgery lies in the cost. According to the American Academy of
Ophthalmology, the average cataract surgery in the United States costs
$3,300 per eye. This is difficult for families in lower income groups
to afford, especially those with no healthcare.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The future treatment of diabetic cataracts
must be approached via a two pronged method. First is the issue of
diabetes management and prevention. This includes maintaining good
blood sugar levels, keeping a healthy blood pressure, and not smoking.
Diets high in carbohydrates and linolenic acid, which is found in
almost all cooking oils, have also been shown to increase the chances
of getting diabetes. <br />
The next step in the two pronged approach directly deals with the
diabetic cataract. Currently the only way to treat cataracts requires
surgery. While some studies have suggested that high doses of vitamin E
can help to reverse cataracts these studies have yet to be proven and
much more research and inquiry must be done. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers have also looked into drugs
that may help to prevent or cure cataracts, but their efforts are
complicated by the fact that the mechanisms of cataract formation are
still not entirely understood. Before any potential drugs can be
tested, the problem of how to administer the drugs must first be
solved. Currently the most common method of administering eye
medication is through eye drops. However, eye drops evaporate
relatively quickly, making them ineffective for treating cataracts due
to the fact that the medication must remain on the eye for a long
period of time in order for it to penetrate the cornea. Also, patients
are often not diligent with their medication and will contaminate it,
causing further damage to their eyes. By bypassing the cornea and
directly injecting the medication into the thick watery substance
between cornea and lens, higher and more sustained levels of the drug
can be achieved. The hope is that the direct injection of medication
into the eye in conjunction with future drugs will reverse the
development of cataracts, providing the patient an alternative to
expensive and risky surgical procedures.<br />

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the United States struggles to deal
with the obesity epidemic, obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes
are expected to continue their upward climb. According to the American
Diabetics Association, a staggering 79 million Americans have
prediabetes, the stage in which individuals are highly at risk for
developing diabetes.&nbsp; Ultimately, the best advice for people to
prevent diabetic cataracts is to eat a healthy balanced diet and to
exercise regularly. This will cut medical costs, reduce stress due to
surgeries and vision loss, and help us continue to see clearly even as
we enter our golden years.<br />
