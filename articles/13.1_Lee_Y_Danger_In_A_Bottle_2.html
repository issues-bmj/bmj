<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Bottled water&#8217;s plastic container also lowers
its water quality. Plastic is composed of various chemicals that, if
leaked into the water, can be toxic to the drinker. Such leaking can
occur if the bottles are exposed to heat or kept on the shelf for an
extended period of time. One of the hazardous chemicals that can be
transferred from the inner lining of the plastic to water is
Bisphenol-A (BPA), a key component of clear rigid plastic as well as a
known hormone disruptor. Professor Frederick von Saal, PhD, at the
University of Missouri has recently found that even small doses of BPA
could have adverse effects on humans. Other studies have shown that BPA
exposure damages reproductive organs in test animals and induces
aneuploidy, an error in cell division that causes miscarriages and
birth defects such as Down Syndrome. In addition to BPA, a group of
chemical compounds known as phthalates are added to plastic bottles to
make them less brittle. Phthalates are environmental contaminants that
can exhibit hormone-like behaviors and, like BPA, act as hormone
disruptors. Recently, phthalates were banned by the European Parliament
from being used in children&#8217;s toys.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When examining the dangers of bottled water, one
aspect which certainly can- not be overlooked is the detrimental effect
that the bottles have on the environment. Bottled water companies are
drying out springs and aquifers and destroying habitats. Corporations
like Nestlé and Coca-Cola have been accused of questionable
environmental practices and of causing water shortages both in the U.S.
and other countries, such as India.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regrettably, plastic has become the fastest growing
sector of the waste stream, making up 25 percent of the volume of
materials sent to landfills each year. Furthermore, an increased use of
water bottles is one of the key factors contributing to the overall
drop in the recycling rate. &#8220;It is a big problem because the recycling
rate [of water bottles] is extremely low,&#8221; says Jenny Gitlitz, director
of research at the California Recycling Institute. She adds that only
around 11 percent of water bottles are being recycled. It does not help
that currently only three states in the U.S. carry a deposit for water
bottles which encourages recycling by giving back a few cents for each
bottled recycled.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gitlitz emphasizes the seriousness of the problem.
&#8220;People think because they&#8217;ve had curbside recycling for ten, fifteen
years, that the current program is working. In fact, the recycling rate
for plastic (PET) bottles has dropped. The issue should command more
attention than it has been getting.&#8221; In 2004, approximately six to
eight million barrels of crude oil were used to make 41 billion PET
bottles, and at least one million tons of greenhouse gases were emitted
to replace the PET bottles that were wasted that year alone.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the problem could be alleviated by increasing
the container redemption value of the bottles, Gitlitz adds that [check
quote] &#8220;it is the beverage industries&#8212;like Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola, and
Anheuser Busch&#8212;rather than container industries who lobby against
bottle bills because they do not want to pay for the collection of
bottles.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, there are solutions to these health and
environmental problems posed by bottled water. The simplest way to
start making a difference is to choose tap water over the bottled
variety. If local tap water is unappealing, using filters may be a good
alternative. However, people should do their best to limit the effect
bottles have on the environment by remembering to toss their empty
bottle into the recycling bin or by choosing bottled water brands such
as Biota that utilize biodegradable bottles. If consumers keep in mind
that bottled water can pose a danger to themselves as well as to the
environment, buying water from a bottle may no longer be seen as such a
necessity.<br />
