<h3 style="text-align: center;">Fatherhood and Testosterone<br />

<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="fatherhood testosterone" src="19.1_Barbour_R_Fatherhood.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A recent study conducted by researchers affiliated with Northwestern
University and the University of San Carlos has revealed a surprising
twist in the biology of humans: fatherhood leads to a dramatic lowering
of men&#8217;s testosterone levels. Where society seems to have designated
testosterone as the essence of masculinity, this finding may be
alarming to the average man -- does fatherhood also mark the loss
masculinity?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scientific community has long established a
connection between fatherhood and testosterone levels, but the exact
nature of the relationship has remained unclear. Previously conducted
studies have shown that fathers&#8217; testosterone levels measure lower than
those of men without children, leading to the belief that fatherhood
curbs testosterone levels so as to reorient a father&#8217;s concern away
from securing a mate and toward the caretaking of their pre-existing
family. However, these studies only measured men&#8217;s testosterone levels
at a single point in time. The data could thus neither prove this
hypothesis nor rule out the possibility that it is simply that men with
lower testosterone levels are those who are more likely to become
fathers in the first place.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent longitudinal study published in September
2011 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is the first to
show how men&#8217;s testosterone levels in relation to fatherhood change
over a prolonged period of time. Testosterone levels were measured
through saliva samples in 624 single 21-year-olds in 2005 and again in
2009, and findings revealed testosterone levels to fluctuate as these
men entered committed relationships and had children. Contrary to a
previous hypothesis, it was in fact the men with initially higher
levels of testosterone who were more likely to become fathers. Upon
entering fatherhood, testosterone levels experienced an average drop of
26% in morning measurements and a drop of 34% in the evening. The study
also found that men who spent at least three hours a day actively
caring for their children had even lower testosterone levels than those
who interacted with their children less often.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple implications stem from these results.
Firstly, understanding the fluctuation of testosterone levels gives
insight into the evolutionary role of the male sex. The changes
indicate that a man&#8217;s hormone levels correlate to the different roles
he performs at different points in his life: testosterone levels are
elevated while a man is in search of a mate, and drop dramatically when
his responsibility becomes the care and protection of his family. The
study left open the possibility that a man&#8217;s testosterone levels are
not permanently altered and that they may rise again as his children
grow up and become less dependent upon paternal care.<br />
