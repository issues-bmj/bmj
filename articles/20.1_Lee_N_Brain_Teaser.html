<h3 style="text-align: center;">Not Your Average Brain Teaser<br />

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Brain Parasites: A Growing Health Concern in California<br />
</h3>

<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="brain parasite headache" src="20.1_Lee_N_Brain_Teaser.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Suffer from headaches? Perhaps it's not the chronic stress and tension
from a busy lifestyle.&nbsp; Perhaps it's not from the annoying
screeching of loud neighbors.&nbsp; And perhaps it's not from sleep
deprivation or dehydration, or any of those commonly prescribed causes
for headaches.&nbsp; Maybe, there are worms in your brain.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara Alverez from Sunnyvale, California
was experiencing precisely that problem.&nbsp; While she was in the
middle of a stroll in the park, numbness suddenly seized her right leg,
and then the rest of her body.&nbsp; The numbness was soon followed by
an incapacitating weakness. Her husband drove her to the Redwood
City&nbsp; Hospital that night.&nbsp; There, doctors madly scrambled to
determine whether she had cancer or tumors, only to discover her
problem was far more unorthodox.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a CT scan that revealed what was
wrong with her.&nbsp; Alverez was diagnosed with neurocysticercosis- a
condition in which calcified tapeworms had become nested in her
brain.&nbsp; Although neurocysticercosis is pretty common in third
world countries, it is not exactly seen as a major health issue in the
United States.&nbsp; Because of this, there is a lack of proper
education regarding this malady.&nbsp; When diagnosed in its early
stages, it can easily and inexpensively treated with steroids.&nbsp;
Putting treatment off, however, can be deadly to both your brain cells
and your wallet.&nbsp; The Center for Disease Control and Prevention
states that hospitalizations due to neurocysticercosis cost an average
of $37,600.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato,
journalist for the Scientific American Journal,&nbsp; Alverez most
likely became infected by eating pork contaminated with tapeworm
larvae.&nbsp; The tapeworm larvae use their incisor-like teeth to tear
into the soft, fleshy intestinal walls.&nbsp; Hooking themselves into
their host, they then commence in draining nutrients from the
body.&nbsp; As horrifying as this sounds, tapeworms at this stage are
still relatively harmless.&nbsp; It&#8217;s when they begin to reproduce that
complications start to arise.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adult tapeworm body structure is
composed of hundreds of segments called proglottids.&nbsp; Older
proglottids contain thousands of eggs, that will regularly be excreted
from the host&#8217;s anus.&nbsp; When other people are infected with
tapeworm eggs, the eggs hatch into larvae, and remain in that
developmental stage.&nbsp; Instead of staying in the intestines,
tapeworm larvae float along the bloodstream like tiny demented
terrorists in a lazy river, using their hooks to rip flesh apart in
their search for richer nutrients.&nbsp; Eventually, some manage to
gain access to the brain.&nbsp; Researchers still aren&#8217;t sure exactly
how the tapeworm larvae are able to traverse the blood-brain
barrier.&nbsp; Some believe that the larvae are able to secrete a type
of enzyme that dissolves a part of the barrier.&nbsp; In any case,
while this is all going on, their human host is usually blissfully
ignorant of the proceedings.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for this is that while they are
alive, tapeworm larvae secrete a thin, mucus-like fluid that tricks the
immune system into thinking everything is fine and dandy.&nbsp; Once
the larvae die, the immune system suddenly realizes that there are
intruders in the brain, and attacks the dead larvae, calcifying
them.&nbsp; This is when the host starts to experience headaches,
seizures, and paralysis.&nbsp; By this stage, surgery is often
necessary.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, according to the Scientific
American Journal, many physicians are unaware of this disease, causing
treatments to be largely postponed.&nbsp; Latinos, the group most
majorly affected by this disease, do not receive education about this
dangerous organism either, and as a result, often do not know what is
going on when they start experiencing the symptoms.&nbsp; Due to lack
of funding, states have not been able to fully address
neurocysticercosis as a medical issue, which is the main factor in why
there is so little awareness about this insidious threat to our health.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if you are a sufferer of chronic
migraines, not to cause alarm (though if the thought of brain-eating
parasites isn&#8217;t a legitimate cause for alarm, I&#8217;m not sure what would
be), but perhaps a visit to the doctor wouldn&#8217;t hurt.<br />
