<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="imedicine ipad medicine" src="19.2_Mock_L_iMedicine.jpg.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shortly after the introduction of the iPad, Bernstein Research reported
that about 4.5 million iPads are being sold every three months
worldwide, a rate faster than the one million units the iPhone sold in
its first quarter, and the 350,000 DVD players sold in the first year.
At this rate, the iPad will surpass gaming hardware and the cellular
phone to become the fourth largest consumer electronics category.
Rapidly rising to ubiquity, it is inevitable that tablet computing will
make its way into medical practices as well, though its adoption in
medicine is still in its infancy, and not without barriers.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spyglass Consulting Group reported that 70% of
doctors own Apple iPad tablets for personal use, but very few use them
within their practice. Other than being an electronic version of a
notepad, the major weakness of the iPad tablet is the lack of
compelling clinical software that can transform patient care delivery
today. Today, few electronic health record vendors offer
iPad-compatible systems.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of computers has been well established in
the medical setting. However, the technology often goes unused, or
intrudes into the doctor-patient relationship as doctors step away to
click at a mouse and tap away on a complicated, non-user-friendly
interface of a clunky PC while examining a patient. Data intensive
health information management systems require doctors to spend much
time entering detailed patient information at a computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowing down the adoption of tablets for medical
applications is a mixture of technology risk and federal regulation. In
general, hospitals are reluctant to embrace any new unproven technology
especially &#8220;consumer-grade&#8221; devices. Issues remain with the device and
software, such as the security of information. Also, being a
general-computing device, the iPad is not regulated by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, while certain medical applications are
regulated. Mobile MIM, a medical imaging app, was the first of a
handful of apps to be cleared by the agency in a process that took
nearly two and a half years.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the current state, much research and
piloting of applications is being done to explore the use of tablet
computing in the healthcare setting, often in medical schools. For
example, a recent study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine
reported that doctors-in-training at the University of Chicago use iPad
tablets to help them become more efficient at ordering tests and
procedures for their patients.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other technology trials have shown that tablets like
the iPad tablet can replace bulky files and free physicians from
workstations to look up patient information no matter where they are &#8212;
at home, while traveling, or doing hospital rounds. With the tablet
computer, doctors can order tests, prescribe drugs, and check medical
records using a computer rather than pen and paper.&nbsp; The U.S.
Veterans Administration has 1,500 iPads in limited trails, most of them
in its Washington, D.C. hospital. Within a year, the administration may
deploy as many as 100,000 tablets across its network of 152 hospitals.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New applications are in the pipeline. In the recent
Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association, researchers
at the Indiana University School of Medicine introduced a tablet-based
application that allows physicians to take a patient&#8217;s medical history.
A visual interface where patients can touch an image of the human body
to indicate sources and severity of pain, and future voice recognition
enhancements on the user interface can further improve the
human-computer-interface so that doctors do not have to type anything.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the Spyglass Consulting Group survey reported
current skepticism by practicing doctors, 80% of physicians
nevertheless believe that the Apple iPad has a promising future in
healthcare. For tablet computing, this is just a start.<br />
