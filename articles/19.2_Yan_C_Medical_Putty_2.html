<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Medical Putty<br />

<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Administration of the putty involves the
injection of the gelatin-like material into the fractured area. The
putty essentially acts as a support similar to the screws and metal
plates currently used. However, it creates an osteoconductive bone
structure, which promotes bone cells to fill a gap between the bone
ends. This will eventually degrade into harmless byproducts that can be
flushed out of the body as the normal bone regenerates. Although the
UGA has not released any specific details on the chemical structure of
their specific fracture putty, they have explained the general process
behind the quick healing of the fracture putty. The main component of
the putty is the use of mesenchymal stem cells in the gel like
substance. Mesenchymal stem cells are very useful in that they can
differentiate into several cell types that include cartilage cells
(chondrocytes) and bone cells (osteoblasts), two of the most important
cells used in bone healing. The putty uses the stem cells to connect
the ligaments together with the new tissue it forms. The stem cells are
housed in a polymer that protects them from harm while the mesenchymal
cells develop, which allows the ligaments to heal themselves. This
process is much quicker than bone grafting because the cells used for
recovery are already located in the putty, as mesenchymal stem cells
can rapidly transform into a specified bone or cartilage cell. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fracture putty developed by the UGA
has shown very promising results so far in clinical trials on small
animals such as mice, allowing injured mice to be up and running with
no observable defects in a period of one to two weeks. Results have
shown that the putty can heal an entire goat's leg, revitalizing the
bone entirely in a period of only four weeks. The group hopes to move
onto testing larger animals to determine if the product they have
created is viable.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another group, consisting of researchers
from Northwestern University and Harvard University, led by
Northwestern professor John Peroni, is using Bionanoscaffolds (BNS),
which contain fundamental building blocks that can be combined with a
structure of polypropylene fumarate (PPF) that can be broken down in
the body with exposure to heat or light. Embedded into the PPF
structure are biodegradable nonporous silicon structures that offer
stability and mechanical reinforcement at a level that is comparable to
an undamaged bone. The slow degradation of the PPF and the eventual
strengthening of the bone allow the transfer of the mechanical load to
the recovering bone, helping its recovery.&nbsp; According to Peroni,
the BNS is also designed to stimulate and promote the self-healing of
the bone since it contains Peptide amphiphiles and molecules that
attract mesenchymal stem cells to the damaged area in question and
force them to differentiate into bone cells, rapidly speeding up the
process. The BNS is also envisioned to release antibiotic agents that
protect the area in question from infection and to promote regrowth of
red blood cells and lymphatic reconstruction. BNS has an extremely
soft-clay texture, so that it can hopefully be applied to any area in
the body unlike its counterpart, the fracture putty. Using,
mathematical models, this group derived several structures that the BNS
could be shaped to be. The research phase of this project is also being
led by a coalition of research groups and is currently applying this
model to rat and rabbit models with different levels of fractures.<br />

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of having a treatment method
for complex fractures will have a significant impact on orthopedics as
a whole. Imagine, instead of waiting a month with a cast on, the bone
itself would be fully functional within a period of one or two days.
Broken bones could be treated as a minor wound and be healed quickly
and effectively with a high chance of success. In addition to improving
the general quality of life, fracture putty could significantly reduce
the number of amputees on the battlefield as combat hospitals would
have a much quicker and effective method for dealing with complex
fractures. The Department of Defense also has high ambitions for
fracture putty, as it hopes it will be used as a facial cranial
replacement, a common wound found on the battlefield. If the project
succeeds, it may increase support for biomedical engineering from the
government and validate the use of stem cells in common everyday
treatments. <br />
