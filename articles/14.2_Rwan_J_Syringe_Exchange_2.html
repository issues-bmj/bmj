<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Syringe Exchange Programs</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Franskoviak continues, &#8220;Similarly, needle
exchange programs meet injection drug users where they&#8217;re at with a
very practical intervention: clean rigs to prevent users from getting
sick from blood- borne viruses and bacteria. SEP also provides another
opportunity for users to meet providers who have a clue about the very
real challenges they face, and this relationship can be a place where
users can begin to have a dialogue about their lives and what&#8217;s
working, what&#8217;s not, as well as to gain safer drug using skills.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public health benefits became apparent as early
as 1997 when the National Institutes of Health Consensus Panel on HIV
Prevention found that injection drug users who participated in syringe
exchanges experienced at least a 30 percent reduction in HIV infections
and an 80 percent reduction in high- risk behaviors.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current studies are underway to determine the
long-term trends of SEP&#8217;s impact on the injection drug user community.
In the November 2006 issue of Addiction, Dezheng Huo, MD, PhD, of the
University of Chicago, along with Susan L. Bailey, PhD, and Lawrence J.
Ouellet, PhD, both professors at the University of Illinois, Chicago&#8217;s
School of Public Health, published a study in which they followed
injection drug users participating in SEP for five years. They
determined that 16 percent of participants stopped injection for a
median duration of 16 months. The authors also found that SEP
participants reduced the frequency of injections by 12 percent per year.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a 1997 Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndromes cost-benefit analysis of AIDS treatment, David Holtgrave,
PhD, of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Steven
Pinkerton, PhD, of The Center for AIDS Intervention Research (CAIR) at
Medical College of Wisconsin, found that syringe exchanges prevented
HIV infections at the cost of $4,000 to $12,000 per person, which is
significantly less than the estimated $190,000 in medical costs of
treating an HIV-infected individual.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SEP is gaining strength across the nation. Public
health authorities and consumer lobby groups such as the Drug Policy
Alliance are fighting for SEP adoption nation-wide. Currently, 47
states have drug paraphernalia laws penalizing the possession of
syringes. To circumvent legislative barriers, public health authorities
are claiming emergencies. In some areas where SEP is legal, local law
enforcement have agreed not to harass or arrest SEP participants. And
as the only state without any sterile syringe access, New Jersey is
currently awaiting governor approval of a state senate health committee
bill to legalize SEP.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These achievements are small steps towards pushing
SEP into mainstream acceptance. The methods behind SEP&#8217;s ounce of
prevention combined with a client-centered approach can also be
integrated into mainstream healthcare practices. For many injection
drug users, harm reduction methods employed by medical and public
health practitioners have helped them achieve healthier lifestyles.
Joe, an injection drug user living in San Francisco whose name has been
changed to protect his privacy, is a supporter of exchange programs. &#8220;I
am grateful for these needle exchanges around the city. I used to get
needles from dealers on the street, and you never knew if the needles
were clean or not. The needle exchange people have helped me live
healthier, and now I bring my friends in and make sure they know how to
live healthy, too.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe&#8217;s comment reveals what many would call the &#8220;dark
side&#8221; of SEP: after three years of participation in SEP, Joe continues
to inject drugs, albeit in a safer manner. Would a federally sponsored
syringe exchange program be tantamount to a legalization of drug use?
Considering the large number of drug-related crimes, the obvious
detrimental effects to a user&#8217;s physical and psychological health and a
longstanding policy against hard substance abuse, why should the
government support such programs? Obviously, the perception of SEP
enabling drug addiction by promoting injection drug use behavior is a
major barrier to national adoption. The federal anti-drug campaign&#8217;s
zero tolerance for drug use is dialectically opposed to the
step-by-step harm reduction approach.</small><br />
