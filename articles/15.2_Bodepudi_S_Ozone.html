Air is a vital commodity that we take for granted. But would you
breathe in a little less if you knew that the air around you could
potentially disarm your immune system?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research by John Hollingsworth, MD, Duke University,
published in the October 2007 issue of Journal of Immunology, reveals
that the air we breathe could shut down the primary immune response in
our lungs and body. Whereas atmospheric ozone prevents damaging
ultraviolet light from reaching the Earth&#8217;s surface, ground-level ozone
may harm the respiratory and immune systems of animals.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ozone is composed of three oxygen atoms, making it
much less stable than the diatomic form of oxygen that is crucial to
our survival. This characteristic instability is a result of ozone&#8217;s
strong oxidizing tendencies. The highest levels of ozone are in the
stratosphere, in the region known as the ozone layer, which protects
living species by filtering out shorter wavelengths of ultraviolet
light from the sun. On the other hand, ground-level ozone, the layer
from which we breathe, was classified as a pollutant by the World
Health Organization in January 2003. Unlike most pollutants, it is not
emitted directly from industrial operations or car exhaust but is
created by the reaction between sunlight and air containing
hydrocarbons produced from smog.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ozone has been proven to exact numerous damaging
effects on the body according to Alexander Leaf, MD, Columbia
University. It breaks down diatomic oxygen to yield free radicals,
which are highly unstable and capable of reacting with and damaging
many organic molecules, setting the foundations for cancer development.
Ozone also converts cholesterol in the bloodstream to plaque, which
causes hardening and narrowing of the arteries. Consequently, recent
scientific interest has stemmed from the human immune response to ozone.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As policymakers debate over safety levels of ozone
in the air, studies in mice reveal that the inhaled pollutant impairs
the body&#8217;s first line of defense, the innate immune response, rendering
it more susceptible to subsequent foreign invaders such as bacteria.
Hollingsworth&#8217;s team found that ozone exposure appears to augment
apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in critical immune system cells,
interfering with their ability to engulf foreign invaders.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the key cells in the nonspecific defense
system is the macrophage, which engulfs and digests substances the body
flags as non-self. Hollingsworth&#8217;s study demonstrated that ozone
exposure in a mouse model reduced the number of macrophages present in
the lungs after being introduced to an inhaled bacterial toxin. Ozone
exposure had stimulated these cells to undergo premature apoptosis.
Without ozone interference, the macrophages would normally function as
scavenger and secretory cells and would attempt to eliminate the
inhaled toxin.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Small amounts of inhaled foreign material can be
relatively harmless, since they stimulate an appropriate innate immune
response that protects the lungs,&#8221; says Hollingsworth. &#8220;However, it
appears that ozone causes the innate immune system to overreact,
killing key immune system cells.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientists are continuing to conduct further studies
on the mechanisms behind ozone&#8217;s ability to induce apoptosis in immune
cells. In the meantime, take into consideration that the fresh air we
breathe everyday might not be as fresh as we think.<br />
