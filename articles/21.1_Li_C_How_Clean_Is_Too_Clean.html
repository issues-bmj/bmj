<h3 style="text-align: center;">Exploring the Benefits of Germ Diversity<br />

<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="bacteria microbe children illness germ free" src="21.1_Li_C_How_Clean_Is_Too_Clean.jpg.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Purell®, Lysol®, Clorox®, as well as countless other brands, offer a
vast variety of cleaning products, disinfectants, and
antibacterials.&nbsp; The general consensus is that the more germ-free,
the better.&nbsp; That belief is in no way unfounded though, since
microbes, such as bacteria, are known to cause many illnesses.&nbsp;
However, there is a point where society&#8217;s obsession with making
everything germ-free may do us harm as well.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that keeping ourselves
and our surroundings germ-free is the best way to prevent the spread of
potentially harmful microbes.&nbsp; In the 1980s, however, scientists
began to notice that children living in developed areas, where
disinfectants and antibacterials were widely used, had greater
incidences of allergies and asthma compared to children residing in
underdeveloped areas.&nbsp; In 1989, British physician Dr. David
Strachan presented a hypothesis to explain this phenomenon.&nbsp;
Dubbed the &#8220;Hygiene Hypothesis,&#8221; it stated that immune disorders,
including allergies and asthma, were increasing among children in
developed countries because of their lowered rates of infections.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, scientific evidence supporting
Dr. Strachan&#8217;s Hygiene Hypothesis has increased.&nbsp; Most of the data
has shown that being exposed to a wide variety of microbes can help
prevent the immune system from overreacting in certain
situations.&nbsp; Currently, scientists are still unsure about exactly
how microbes regulate the immune system.&nbsp; Some scientists have
hypothesized that exposure to different types of bacteria can
correspond to reduced incidence of different types autoimmune
disorders.&nbsp; However, Kevin Bonham, a sixth year immunology
graduate student at Harvard University, argues that this cannot be the
case since exposure to any type of bacteria correlates to an overall
decrease for these autoimmune disorders.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to try to qualify these claims,
there has been an increase in research regarding the presence of
certain microbes in our bodies and autoimmune disease prevention.&nbsp;
Recent research led by Dr. Alexander Chervonsky of the Department of
Pathology at the University of Chicago, found that diabetes can be
influenced by the microbes present in the intestinal tract.&nbsp; The
study observed mice and found that specimens without the microbe
Candidatus Savagella in their intestines would get more severe forms of
diabetes while those with the microbe did not.&nbsp; The Mathis-Benoist
lab at the Harvard Medical School identified this microbe as one that
provided enough protection to prevent diabetes.&nbsp; However, this
bacteria was also more prevalent in animals with other types of
autoimmune disorders so it was not viable for additional research in
methods of diabetes prevention.&nbsp; This case illustrates that while
scientists are still struggling to make sense of the relationship
between microbes and immune responses, there is definitely potential
for further research in this area.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A related study conducted by biologist
Jeffrey Gordon at Washington University in St. Louis found that
intestinal microbes also contributed to obesity in mice.&nbsp; The
microbes were originally taken from a set of human twins, where one
twin was obese and the other was not.&nbsp; Initially, neither mouse
was more prone than the other to gaining weight.&nbsp; However, the
mouse that received the lean twin&#8217;s microbes remained lean while the
mouse that received the obese twin&#8217;s microbes gained weight.&nbsp; This
shows that the gut microbes taken from the twins were a key factor in
determining the weight of the mice.&nbsp; Furthermore, these scientists
also found that, if allowed to interact for an extended period, the
microbes from the lean mouse could transfer to the obese mouse, who
then lost weight. The lean mouse had a greater variety of microbes in
its intestines compared to the obese mouse, so this showed that being
exposed to more microbes helped the obese mouse.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These studies relating microbes and
certain diseases or conditions show that not all microbes are harmful
to us.&nbsp; In fact, many are proving to be beneficial. While being
mindful of germs can reduce infections, being overly so can also lead
to a variety of immune disorders associated with being underexposed to
microbes.&nbsp; Disinfectants and antibacterials that claim to kill
over ninety-nine percent of germs often kill a greater proportion of
germs that increase helpful microbial diversity than germs that
potentially harm us.&nbsp; Each time we consider using these products,
it is important to keep in mind the population of our beneficial
microbes we could be wiping out.<br />
