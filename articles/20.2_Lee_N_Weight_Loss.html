<p style="text-align: center;">Aspire assist weight management device could help battle obesity.<br />

<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="weight management aspire obesity" src="20.2_Lee_N_Weight_Loss.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
People struggling with their weight often wish there was a magical way
to simply flush the excess fat away.&nbsp; It&#8217;s this desire for an
easy, undemanding solution that&#8217;s sustained the commercial success of
so many diet pills that only hold placebos and empty
promises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with the development of Aspire
Assist therapy, it is now possible to literally drain the calories out
of your stomach. &nbsp;<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aspire-Assist is essentially the reverse
of a PEG (feeding tube).&nbsp; The aspiration tube is inserted into the
patient&#8217;s stomach through the mouth, using an endoscope.&nbsp; Then,
the doctor makes a small skin incision and threads the tube out of the
stomach, connecting it to a small &#8220;Skin-Port&#8221; at the surface of the
abdomen.&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire procedure takes about 20 minutes.&nbsp;
After a few days of healing time, patients attach a small hand-held
device to the Skin-Port about 20 minutes after a meal, and empty out a
portion of their stomach contents directly into the toilet.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Many comments about Aspire Assist device seem to state in one form or
another, that&nbsp; it sounds downright revolting.&nbsp; The thought of
squeezing the half-digested remains of your dinner out of a stomach
tube is admittedly, a bit sickening.&nbsp; Additionally, the aspiration
process is disturbingly similar to bulimia, and can be potentially
abused.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For people that are morbidly obese,
however, there aren&#8217;t that many other appealing options
available.&nbsp;&nbsp; Working off hundreds of excess pounds with
traditional diet and exercise requires immense will-power that many
lack.&nbsp; Some resort to bariatric surgeries such as gastric bypass
surgery, vertical sleeve gastrectomy, or adjustable gastric banding
(Lap-bands).&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to Aspire Assist, these procedure are
more invasive, and require greater lifestyle changes.&nbsp; Gastric
bypass surgery involves stapling a portion of the stomach together, and
making the food bypass a portion of the small intestine so that fewer
nutrients are absorbed.&nbsp; In vertical sleeve gastrectomy, surgeons
staple and remove most of the stomach, and in lap-band surgery, an
adjustable band is used to constrict the upper stomach.&nbsp; According
to &#8220;Review on Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy for Morbid Obesity&#8221;,
average hospital stays for bariatric surgeries run from 2-4 days. In
comparison, the Aspire Assist surgery is an outpatient procedure with
an average hospital stay of two hours.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common side effects of lap-bands and
gastric bypass include vomiting or diarrhea, an effect that has not
been observed with aspiration.&nbsp; Also, while bariatric surgery
patients are limited to drastically tiny (~1cup) meals, people
undergoing aspiration therapy can eat normal meals, and gradually work
towards healthier eating habits.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a 4% chance of
serious complication in the form of Buried Bumper Syndrome with
aspiration therapy.&nbsp; However, this risk is negligible compared to
the risks of serious complication associated with bariatric surgery:
There is a 14-24% risk of complications such as staple line failure,
bleeding, ulcers, and death in these surgeries, making aspiration
surgery the much safer alternative. The aspiration device can be used
long-term, but if the patient successfully reaches their weight goal,
and implements a healthier diet and exercise regimen, the aspiration
tube can also be used less often, and eventually removed in a 15 minute
procedure at the hospital.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Aspire Bariatrics, Aspire
Assist therapy has comparable weight-loss results with bariatric
surgery patients.&nbsp; In their US clinical trial, 24 obese patients
lost an average of 45 pounds in their first year of aspiration.&nbsp;
Aspiration is meant to be accompanied by medical monitoring and
lifestyle counseling to insure proper usage, and to reduce the risk of
complications such as infections.&nbsp; Aspire Assist has received CE
approved for the European Union, but is still running more clinical
trials, and pending FDA approval for usage in the U.S.&nbsp; At this
rate, it looks like Americans may have to wait a few more years before
we can start flushing our calories down the toilet.<br />
