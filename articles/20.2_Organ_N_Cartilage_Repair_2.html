<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Stem Cell Research Targets Cartilage Repair</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the recent study dealt only with
fish. It doesn&#8217;t show what the effects of these trace amounts of drugs
are on humans &#8211; if they have any effects at all. Professional opinions
vary on this. Dr. Karl Fent of University of Applied Sciences
Northwestern Switzerland states that &#8220;drinking water contamination by
pharmaceuticals seems not to be critical.&#8221; Dr. Christian Daughton of
the Environmental Protection Agency, on the other hand, sees matters
differently. He provided direction to an article of his, published in
2010 in the ACS Symposium Series, in which he states: &#8220;That [active
pharmaceutical ingredients] can occur in drinking water certainly poses
complex questions regarding the significance of long-term human
exposure. Although the minute concentrations when compared with
therapeutic doses appear to be far below those that might pose any
health concerns, the possibility of delayed-onset health effects cannot
yet be ruled out.&#8221; <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the real threat comes not from
drinking the tap water, but in eating fish who have lived in
contaminated water. If the medications become concentrated in the
bodies of fish, you may be getting a higher dose than you realize when
you eat these fish. The Swedish researchers led by T. Brodin found that
&#8220;The concentration of oxazepam in muscle tissue of European perch
(Perca fluviatilis) from River Fyris was more than six times that in
the water.&#8221; <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another unknown is what effect various
other drugs have on fish. Researchers in this study tested only
anti-anxiety drugs, but quite a few others have been found in our tap
water &#8211; such as the sex hormones in San Francisco. These other
medications found in tap water may have even more profound effects on
fish &#8211; or they may have no effects at all. At this point, we simply do
not know. We also do not yet know whether trace amounts of these other
drugs have any impact on us humans at all. Dr. Fent even states that
&#8220;the interpretation of the behavioral changes [of the fish] might be
somehow exaggerated.&#8221;<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, unfortunately, there is not
a clear solution to this situation of pharmaceutical-contaminated tap
water. You could avoid tap water entirely in favor of bottled water.
However, some bottled water is simply glorified, filtered tap water
(and there is no reason to think the filtering process would remove the
medications). For that matter, if you are one of the many people who
try to avoid eating or drinking from plastic containers, this option
may be even less appealing than drinking contaminated tap water.
Perhaps, continuing UC Berkeley&#8217;s long history of protests and driving
change, the best solution is to pressure water treatment plants to
develop more sophisticated technology that can handle the task of
removing these medications from the water. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all the pollution in our world &#8211; from
the day-to-day like smog to the occasional orders to stay indoors after
an accident at the Chevron refinery in Richmond &#8211; a bit of medication
in your tap water may be the least of your worries. And hey, maybe the
anti-anxiety drugs will even help your mood&#8230; at least, if you&#8217;re lucky
enough to have those particular drugs in your water.<br />
