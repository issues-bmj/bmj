<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from The Spectrum of Autism<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, according to Shih, this is most
likely not the only contributor to autism. &#8220;There is a consensus in the
scientific community that it probably is not just one autism, but
autisms, like cancer,&#8221; Shih says. &#8220;There will be generally similar
symptoms, or behaviors, but the causes and mechanisms are likely to be
very different. Synaptic junctions are most likely not the only cause
of autism. But the hope is that AGP will be able to shed light on other
mechanisms as well.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second phase of the project will focus on
expanding the researchers&#8217; results and confirming their findings on
autism. Ultimately, the project will enable doctors to diagnose the
disorder more easily and accurately, and may even produce new
treatments. &#8220;The expectation is that this project will identify genes
that autistic people have in common and the handful of genes related to
higher risk factors,&#8221; Shih says. &#8220;Once you have these identified, it is
not so far of a leap to develop gene-based diagnostic tests.&#8221; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another recent discovery focuses on the gut-brain
association with autistic symptoms, which has long been considered a
possible cause, albeit a relatively unstudied one. &#8220;Some people with
autism have problems with the digestive system, very strange food
cravings that a lot of times make symptoms worse, as has been seen in
studies and by families,&#8221; Derrick MacFabe, MD, University of Western
Ontario, says. &#8220;In the world of just neurology there is a lot less
wrong with these kids&#8217; brains than with other diseases.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MacFabe led a team conducting research on propionic
acid (PPA), a short-chain fatty acid that exists in the
gastrointestinal tract and is a common food preservative, and its
effects on animal models. The July 2007 paper in Behavioral Brain
Research supported the hypothesis that PPA is linked with autism
symptoms, and though it only deals with the effects of PPA in rats, the
various ways researchers studied the effects &#8211; through behavior, brain
models, and other analyses &#8211; revealed interesting similarities to
autism in humans.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;We took a small amount of this compound and put it
into animals, and it immediately caused autistic behavior like
repetitiveness and the animals ignoring each other,&#8221; MacFabe says.
&#8220;When the compound was broken down the animals went back to normal.
This is very different than the static view of the disease as an
unalterable condition in the brain.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This finding points to a genetically-inherited
inability to break down PPA, thus bridging common environmental and
genetic theories about autism. PPA affects the brain&#8217;s cellular pH,
brain metabolism, and intercellular communication. Furthermore,
researchers found that rodents treated with PPA had brain tissue with
impaired glutathione metabolism, which is crucial in cell regulation
and antioxidant defense. Glutathione deficiency can result in
sensitivity to toxic compounds, especially metals, thus underscoring a
link between environmental factors, the gut, and the brain in autism.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The discovery also lends itself to a method of
alleviating autistic symptoms. Since PPA is found in many dairy and
bread products, parents may be able to ameliorate an autistic child&#8217;s
symptoms by cutting out foods that &#8220;trigger&#8221; symptomatic reactions.
&#8220;The good news is that if this is similar in neurology to other
diseases like it, we&#8217;re able to do something about it,&#8221; MacFabe says.
&#8220;There&#8217;s great potential for finding environmental factors of autism
that are potentially preventable.&#8221; MacFabe is still examining how the
PPA-autism link works, but so far it has also provided a connection
with other possible autism causes, like pesticides.</small><br />
