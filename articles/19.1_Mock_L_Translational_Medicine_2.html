<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Translational
Medicine</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, there is little financial or regulatory
incentive for
research sponsors to spend limited resources on analyzing and reporting
results from failed clinical trials. In a recent commentary in the
September 2011 issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">Science
Translational Medicine</span> journal, Michael
Rogawski, Chair of the Department of Neurology in the UC Davis School
of Medicine protested, &#8220;Translational medicine cannot approach its full
potential if negative drug developments are unpublished.&#8221;
Co-commentator, Howard J. Federoff, a neuroscientist and Dean of the
School of Medicine of Georgetown University added, &#8220;Such reporting
would lead to greater patient safety, improve treatment research
strategies, and allow a more efficient use of limited resources.&#8221;
Moreover, the opportunities to learn and improve research yield are
vast: the 21 new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration in
2010, appears relatively paltry in comparison to the number of medical
research papers that were published annually, over 800,000 in 2008, and
the federal spending in medical research that has almost doubled in the
past decade to over $30 billion in 2010.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the great potential for
translational medicine to accelerate
processes and improve research yields, some remain skeptical of
applying engineering techniques to solve medical problems.&nbsp; Derek
Lowe, a drug research scientist wrote in his blog, &#8220;medical research is
different than semiconductor research. It's harder. Ever seen one of
those huge blow-ups of a chip's architecture? It's awe-inspiring, the
amount of detail that's crammed into such a small space. And guess what
- it's nothing, it's the instructions on the back of a shampoo bottle
compared to the complexity of a living system.&#8221; <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, seeing such potential
benefits, academic medical centers
across the United States like ones at Stanford University, The
University of Pennsylvania, and Duke University have established
program offices to coordinate implementation of translational medicine.
The University of California in San Francisco (UCSF), for example,
proactively promotes translational medicine through its Clinical and
Translational Science Institute (CTSI). The CTSI encouraged the
partnership and collocation of biotechnology and pharmaceutical
companies like Bayer, Celgene and Merck near the new UCSF campus to
work with university labs to accelerate new discoveries to practical
applications. In addition, within university research programs,
scientists receive, with patient permission, rapid feedback on the
progress of treatments to help researchers learn from the results of
in-clinic patient care.<br />
<br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many universities have also established
translational medicine studies
as a post-graduate discipline. The Master&#8217;s in Translational Medicine,
a two year program of the University of California at Berkeley and
UCSF, was launched in fall 2010 through a $1.5 million gift from Andy
Grove.&nbsp; Today, leading research in translational medicine is
announced through conferences and new publications such as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Journal
of Translational Medicine</span>, launched in 2003, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The American Journal
of Translational Research</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Science
Translational Medicine</span>, both
which began publication in 2009.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The importance of translational medicine
cannot be underestimated. In a
Fall 2002 letter to readers of <span style="font-style: italic;">Stanford Medicine Magazine</span>, Philip
Pizzo, M.D., Dean of the Stanford School of Medicine, said, &#8220;In the
absence of translational and patient-oriented clinical research, the
delivery of medical care would remain stagnant and uninformed by the
tremendous progress now taking place in biomedical science.&#8221; Today, for
every 5,000 to 10,000 compounds that enter drug discovery phase, only
one reaches final FDA approval. Yet, as research continues in the
emerging field of translational medicine, scientists, clinicians,
patients, industry, and policymakers will continue to accelerate and
improve processes, assuring that nothing gets lost in translation.</small><br />
