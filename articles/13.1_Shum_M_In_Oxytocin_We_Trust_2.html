<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from In Oxytocin We Trust<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, Dr. Heinrichs has investigated
oxytocin&#8217;s specific relationship to trusting behavior. His research
suggests that oxytocin does not specifically stimulate trust, but
instead helps an individual &#8220;overcome his or her social avoidance
behavior.&#8221; His findings have revealed that oxytocin &#8220;attenuates
behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to social stress&#8221; and increases
the &#8220;stress-protective&#8221; effects of social interaction. Most
importantly, Dr. Heinrichs emphasizes that the presence of social
interaction is &#8220;crucial&#8221; for the operation of the behavioral,
cognitive, and emotional effects of oxytocin. The results suggest that
an oxytocin-derived drug could eventually be used to treat various
social phobias, anxiety disorders, and even autism.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Heinrichs and Dr. Kosfeld have led the way in
human-oriented research for oxytocin. Heinrichs&#8217; team is currently
conducting a series of studies on the clinical effects of oxytocin on
disorders such as social phobia, and their research combines oxytocin
administration with cognitive-behavioral therapy.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Keltner, on the other hand, prefers
therapy-based interventionist treatments of extreme developmental
disorders like autism, but he indicates that the use of oxytocin or
similar drugs in extreme circumstances would be permissible. &#8220;Autistic
children have trouble making emotional connections, do not respond to
touch, and have trouble understanding emotion. If you can make these
kids more connected through oxytocin, I&#8217;d be for that.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prospect of such a potentially powerful drug
also comes with negative implications, such as abuse or misuse,
prompting the need for federal oversight. Walter Freeman, PhD, of UC
Berkeley, believes oxytocin has &#8220;real potential&#8221; for the therapy of
chronic mental disorders, though he adds that its benefits may be
outweighed by its potential for misuse.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Freeman acknowledges that the likelihood of a
panic scene is low. He adds, however, that the &#8220;individual dosage to
recruits given by cults, gangs, military and paramilitary cadres,
evangelist churches could easily lead to abuse, if the route of
administration is tolerable. It can just as easily be forced.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He notes that if &#8220;the drug is as effective as
ecstasy was found to be, and if it is widely adopted by organizations
preying on adolescents, poor people, the homeless, prisoners in jails,
pimps recruiting prostitutes, and corporations instilling corporate
ethos, then I expect the Federal government will make it a Class One
controlled substance.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Dr. Heinrichs, oxytocin intranasal
spray is available in all pharmacies in Europe, but prescriptions are
dispensed only to aid lactation in breast-feeding women. Because
oxytocin cannot be administered orally and has no psychotropic effects
like many other drugs, Dr. Heinrichs dispelled notions that this
hormone could be manipulated.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Thank God there is no technical solution to
indirectly manipulate people with oxytocin,&#8221; Dr. Heinrichs said. &#8220;So,
it&#8217;s not likely that political operators will generously spray the
crowd with oxytocin at rallies of their candidates.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Heinrichs and Dr. Kosfeld concluded their report
in Nature by suggesting that their findings may yield &#8220;positive
clinical implications for patients with mental disorders that are
associated with social dysfunctions.&#8221; They believe their current
clinical studies of oxytocin may lead to &#8220;fertile research on the role
of oxytocin in several mental health disorders with major public health
significance.&#8221; Dr. Heinrichs&#8217; team expects final results in the
beginning of 2006.<br />
