The time is blue:yellow. It&#8217;s 6:30. When I see the number six, I always
see blue. And three is always yellow,&#8221; describes Michelle Uziel, a
senior at the University of California, Berkeley. Michelle is not
speaking metaphorically or experiencing hallucinations. In fact, her
tendency to see numbers as colors is actually caused by synesthesia, a
congenital phenomenon that affects the brain.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synesthesia &#8211; &#8220;joined sensation&#8221; &#8211; is a neurological
condition wherein the stimulation of one sensory submodality evokes the
perception of another, such that a person might not only hear a voice
but also see, feel, or taste it. Most people who experience synesthesia
associate colors to letters and numbers. In rare cases, these
experiences can involve three or more senses. Whatever the associations
may be, they are always the same for a given person but often unique to
each individual. For Michelle, seeing the number six always produces
the color blue. For another person, seeing apples always tickles.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the July 1995 edition of the journal Psyche,
Richard Cytowic, MD, reported that an estimated one in 25,000 people
had some form of synesthesia at the time of publication. Now that we
know more about the disease, its apparent prevalence is rising. &#8220;It is
now estimated that at least one out of 200 people have the condition,&#8221;
says Bryan Alvarez, a graduate student in psychology and synesthesia
researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What causes synesthesia? Although its etiology
remains ambiguous, experts agree that the condition is hereditary.
Cytowic explains, &#8220;[It] runs in families in a pattern consistent with
either autosomal or X- linked dominant transmission [&#8230;] To give some
flavor of the pedigrees I have encountered, one family has one
synesthete in each of four generations, while another family has four
synesthetes out of five siblings in the same generation.&#8221; Furthermore,
the condition is more common in women, left-handers, and people who
tend to be artistic or creative.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although synesthesia has been acknowledged since
1880 when Charles Darwin&#8217;s cousin, Francis Galton, introduced it in a
Nature article, it has gained more scientific interest in recent years
as researchers are beginning to realize that it may hold the secrets to
unraveling one of the greatest mysteries of the mind: the binding
problem. The processing of colors and shapes and other higher-order
visual computations are widely distributed across the cerebral cortex.
Several neurological research campaigns are currently striving to
figure out just how the brain pulls all of these visual elements
together to form mental images. Altogether, this constitutes the
binding problem.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People who experience synesthesia inherently exhibit
an altered binding that creates aberrant perceptual experiences.
Consequently, scientists have strategically examined abnormal binding
in synesthetes to learn more about how the brain normally creates
perceptions. Alvarez, who also studies the binding problem,
enthusiastically remarks, &#8220;It is very exciting to figure out how such a
fundamental process of our consciousness works. Inspired by my own
synesthesia, I am conducting research on how people synthesize single
elements of perception into a complete one.&#8221;<br />
