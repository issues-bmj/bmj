<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Dead Embryos Give Life</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming that living embryonic stem cells can
be harvested from arrested embryos, the ethical debate may soon be over
&#8211; for some. Nevertheless, many assert that rather than ameliorating the
ethical debate, the recent conclusions of Stojkovic and associates have
raised challenging philosophical questions. First of all, how do we
know that the embryo is really &#8220;dead?&#8221; Ben A. Rich, JD, PhD, an
associate professor of bioethics at the University of California,
Davis, compares this issue to the concept of brain death. He says that,
&#8220;Although we have a set of critical criteria to determine if all brain
function has ceased and we call that individual dead, we want absolute
certainty, which is not available.&#8221; Even though the death of an embryo
is defined as its inability to undergo cell division after a period of
24 to 48 hours, there is no way to conclusively prove that the embryos
Stojkovic used would stop growing if they were implanted into a woman&#8217;s
uterus. After all, there is always the possibility that artificial
laboratory conditions may have stumped embryological development.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An interesting implication that stems from this
argument questions the morality of intentionally discarding embryos
that could potentially be of great benefit to human health. According
to Erich H. Loewy, MD, professor and founding chair of bioethics at the
University of California, Davis, although an embryo may have the
ability to proliferate its cells and thus &#8220;be alive,&#8221; it may not &#8220;have
a life.&#8221; He comments, &#8220;Being alive is a biological statement that
applies to tissue cultures, spinach, amoebas, dogs, and college
students, while having a life means possessing self-awareness, an idea
that there was a past, there is now a present, and there may be a
tomorrow.&#8221; Being alive is the necessary condition for having a life,
but as yet it is merely a potential. Further, since stem cell therapy
has shown a host of uses in dealing with a number of illnesses, it may
be argued that failure to experiment with stem cells from an embryo
destined to be discarded is unethical. Hence, some may contend that it
is immoral to refuse to carry out experiments that could revolutionize
medicine.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also possible that the new findings may have
little or no impact on those that regard research on living human
embryos as an unethical practice to begin with. As Roberta S. Loewy,
PhD, associate clinical professor of bioethics at the University of
California, Davis says, &#8220;Those who take the most polarized anti- human
embryo destruction stance will not be swayed by the claim that the
embryos are now dead or arrested.&#8221; Instead, it is likely that the
&#8220;pro-life absolutist&#8221; position will continue to argue that collecting
excess embryos even for the purpose of in vitro fertilization is in and
of itself unethical.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No longer just an idea, the capacity of &#8220;dead&#8221;
embryos to yield living stem cells has been discovered, bringing us one
step closer to creating artificial tissue for transplantation. Still,
further inquiry and examination must be made before new treatments for
widespread diseases like diabetes and Parkinson&#8217;s are developed.
Unfortunately, with such power comes immense responsibility, leaving
the debate over the ethics of stem cell research alive and well.</small><br />
