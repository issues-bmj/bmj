<h3 style="text-align: center;">Drinking Drugs<br />

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Pharmaceuticals in Our Tap Water</h3>

<p><small><br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="pharmaceutical drug water" src="20.2_Holm_G_Drinking_Drugs.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you been feeling irritated, anti-social, and hungry? If so, drinking your tap water may be the problem.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time you take a sip of water from
your sink, you may be consuming chemicals that can cause fish to become
hyper and aggressive. A team of Swedish researchers led by T. Brodin
recently discovered that minute amounts of oxazepam, a common
anti-anxiety medication, can cause profound behavioral changes in
European perch &#8211; and it doesn&#8217;t make them more relaxed. In addition to
becoming more hyper and aggressive, these fish became less social and
even started eating more than their un-drugged counterparts.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disturbing connection to your tap
water is this: water treatment plants aren&#8217;t designed to deal with
medication. Once medications enter the water system, they are there to
stay. When someone flushes his or her leftover anti-anxiety pills down
the toilet, there is nothing to stop trace amounts of the drugs from
reaching your sink. These medications can also enter our water system
in less conspicuous ways. Sometimes your body does not metabolize all
of the medications you take. This means that when you go to the
bathroom, there are trace amounts of the medication in your urine &#8211;
and, again, the drugs are not filtered out by water treatment plants.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This may all sound too strange to be true,
or like the kind of problem that only affects a few small groups of
people. After all, it seems like major metropolitan areas must have
state-of-the-art water treatment plants that would remove drugs from
the water.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not the case. A 2008 investigation
by the Associated Press, known by the name PharmaWater, found that at
least 1 in 6 Americans has drug-tainted tap water. And these aren&#8217;t
just the rural Americans with questionable treatment plants. The
investigators found that water even in San Francisco was contaminated &#8211;
and with sex hormones, at that.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be fair, the concentrations of drugs in
the water are quite low. The minute amounts of the drugs in tap water
may offer some reassurance. However, that is where the study about fish
comes into play. Remember, the perch showed marked behavioral
differences with just two parts per billion of these common medications
in their water. That is the equivalent of putting about 1/32nd of a
teaspoon &#8211; or about two drops &#8211; into a large 16&#8217; by 34&#8217; backyard
swimming pool. In other words, it does not take much to have a profound
behavioral impact on the fish.<br />
