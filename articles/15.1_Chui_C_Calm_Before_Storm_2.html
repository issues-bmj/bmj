<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from The Calm Before the Storm</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the biggest TB threat comes from the
XDR-TB strains, defined in 2006 as MDR-TB that is also resistant to any
fluoroquinolone and at least one of the three following injectable
drugs: capreomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin. Like MDR strains, XDR
strains arise due to the inappropriate use of SLDs in a patient for
whom first-line drugs are failing. A March 2006 report by the CDC and
the World Health Organization (WHO) documented the presence of XDR-TB
in at least seventeen countries. Though not representative, the data
showed that in the United States four percent of MDR-TB strains were
XDR strains. &#8220;The emergence of XDR-TB arises from a collective failure
to implement large scale and effective anti-tuberculosis programs in
all parts of the world.&nbsp; We are all responsible for this failure,&#8221;
says Richard Feachem, DSc, executive director of The Global Fund to
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Popular belief postulates that TB is not a major
threat in the US, but this misconception hampers effective and
aggressive action to combat the upsurge of MDR and XDR strains.
Scientists face challenges in conveying information about the MDR-TB
threat to the general public because &#8220;the public is under the
impression that the disease is not threatening here [...] it is
difficult to make people care about TB unless it directly affects them
or their immediate family or friends,&#8221; says Lee Riley, MD, professor of
Epidemiology and Infectious diseases at the University of California,
Berkeley.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the US TB incidence decreased steadily
at about five percent annually from 1953 until 1985, before reversing
and peaking at a prevalence of ten cases per every 100,000 individuals
in 1992.&nbsp; According to the CDC&#8217;s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report published in March 2006, between 1993 and 2004, a total of 2,689
MDR-TB cases were identified, of which 74 met the criteria for
XDR-TB.&nbsp; Despite an overall decline in MDR-TB incidence in the
United States, the proportion of this illness has increased slightly,
climbing from 3.9 percent of cases from 1993 to 1996 to 4.5 percent
from 2001 to 2004.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; California composes a startlingly high number of
cases. In 2003, California reported the most cases in the nation. Over
the past decade, the proportion of cases with MDR-TB has remained
constant. CDC data indicate that 83 percent of MDR-TB cases in
California were foreign-born.&nbsp; The countries of origins for most
immigrants&#8212;Mexico, the Philippines, and Vietnam&#8212;have demonstrated
prevalence of drug resistance that are two to four times that of such
strains in the United States.&nbsp; Despite these alarming figures,
most people, such as students, workers, or undocumented immigrants from
countries with high TB rates, enter the United States sans any TB
screening. As a result, MDR-TB is often unidentified until diagnosis in
the United States. Additionally, there can be considerable local
variation in TB rates. For example, while TB strain drug resistance
declined in the United States as a whole from 1993 to 2002 and the
proportion of MDR-TB cases was reduced by about half, the proportions
of drug-resistant and MDR-TB in San Diego, California have remained
relatively unchanged. If California does not devote more resources to
its TB-control programs, we may have an epidemic on our hands. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Without urgent and concerted action, in five years
time, I would expect the XDR-TB problem to have worsened considerably.
The solution lies in two areas. First, existing programs to treat
ordinary tuberculosis and MDR-TB have to be both expanded and improved
in their quality.&nbsp; Second, research has to bring us radically
better diagnostic tests and drugs applicable to both MDR-TB and XDR-TB.
This will take time,&#8221; warns Feachem.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we list the conquests of modern medicine, our
victory over tuberculosis is often high on the list. Unfortunately, the
disease is far from being on its last legs. In fact, the exhaustive,
perhaps too exhaustive, use of antibiotics has led to the resurrection
of &#8220;consumption&#8221; in an ever more threatening form, that of XDR- TB.
This disease has emerged as a worldwide threat, raising concerns of a
future epidemic of a virtually untreatable disease.</small><br />
