Whether it is crooning from the radio, blasting in your friend&#8217;s dorm,
or beating from your expensive headphones, music is everywhere in your
life. Since music is such an important piece of your life, have you
ever wondered how your brain responds to the stereo symphony of sound
around you? Interestingly to know, your favorite genre of music could
be responsible for the development of your intelligence since an early
age! Even now, it&#8217;s possible that it can be affecting your behavior and
ability to perform in your classes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people have taken musical lessons as a child.
It might be a good idea to thank your mom for forcing you to go to
violin lessons every week because studies show that performing such
music creates changes in your brain that lasts for many years to come
as you develop into who you are today. Data confirms that communication
skills and reading ability are correlated to musical training
experience.&nbsp; A good reader and speaker is able to pick out
specific speech sounds, put meaning to these sounds, and retain the
information in their memory for next time. Taking musical lessons and
listening to music every day are proven to improve these parts of your
brain. Think of it as a muscle--the more you work out, the stronger it
gets. This analogy is of great import when extended to consider
musicians or music aficionados. By listening to music and speech all
around you, your brain stores these experiences and is able to react
better the next time. According to a study done by the Auditory
Neuroscience Laboratory at Northwestern University, the brain&#8217;s
response to music heavily depends on one&#8217;s experience with musical
training--specifically, a musically trained brain records much clearer
activity than a non-musically trained brain. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Musical training does not require hours of studying
classical theory. Simply listening to your favorite iPod playlists
everyday also helps train your brain to distinguish the many sounds
blended in the musical production process. This easy training helps you
to pick out minor details in songs, enhancing your brain&#8217;s ability to
discern other subtleties it can detect in everyday sounds and speech.
It is this skill of being able to pick out subtleties that trains
people who are hard of hearing or experiencing hearing loss to
understand speech amongst a noisy background. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music can not only being enjoyment into one&#8217;s life,
but can also enhance the quality of it on a scientific level. Consider
the profound impact music could has had on your life without your
knowledge! In an urban college campus, sounds are creating music all
around you--and it might be beneficial if you sit down and listen a
little closer.<br />
