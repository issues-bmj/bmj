</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This experiment shows that Toxo infections
cause loss of aversion to feline predators in mice. This behavior
change would make infected mice more likely to be prey, but why would a
parasite want its host to become eaten? Toxo can only complete its
lifecycle in the gut of a cat, making the mouse a crucial vector for
reproduction. By manipulating the mice to lose their innate fear of
cats, Toxo can reproduce. In the cat&#8217;s gut, Toxo forms oocysts, a thick
walled structure which protects developing Toxo parasites, which serves
to transfer them to new hosts. These oocysts can survive harsh
environments and will release the parasites after it is ingested by its
new host. Once inside the host, the parasite can ensconce itself within
neurons, create dormant cysts in the brain, and potentially stay in a
host for its entire life. But even if it is eliminated from the host,
Ingram&#8217;s experiment shows that behavioral changes can persist.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The permanence of behavior changes is not
only significant to understanding Toxo, but also when considering the
possibility that other pathogens also have the potential to cause
permanent changes. Currently, the field of medicine assumes that
pathogens cause symptoms such as fever, pains, etc, and that the
elimination of the pathogen from the body will also cure the symptoms.
However, there are some medical cases where there are symptoms but no
detectable culprit. Could it be that these symptoms are caused by Toxo
like infections which also can cause permanent changes after infection?
Though more research is needed, Ingram believes this study could change
the current paradigm of treating symptoms and diseases and help health
professionals better understand how to treat symptoms. Perhaps medical
history is an important piece of the puzzle when treating patients.
Ingram states that a powerful new direction of medicine is to use
anti-bodies to see all the pathogens a patient has interacted with. The
body produces antibodies every time it mounts an immune response to a
pathogen, and these antibodies are left in a patient's bloodstream. By
studying antibodies, medical professionals can study past and present
infections to find the culprit for symptoms and provide a more
effective method of treatment. Toxo is making waves in the medical
community, and further research may provide key insights into battling
currently untreatable symptoms.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxo is by no means understood yet, and
Ingram plans to continue studying the exact mode of infection of Toxo.
Further research into the mode of infection will not only help health
professionals better understand &#8220;permanent&#8221; symptoms of infections, but
hopefully also provide strategies for treating such symptoms.<br />
