<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Just how effective is the medication? A trial
run by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and sponsored by the
National Cancer Institute between 2001 and 2004 found that lung cancer
patients who received Avastin® and chemotherapy had a median survival
time of 12.5 months while those who received chemotherapy alone had a
median survival time of only 10.2 months. The drug did not emerge from
this trial spotless, however. About one percent of the patients of the
test group died of internal bleeding, mostly in the lungs, while no one
in the control group suffered this fate. Although Avastin® is currently
only approved for colon and lung cancer treatment, ongoing clinical
trials are testing its effectiveness against other cancers, such as
breast and ovarian cancer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another anti-angiogenesis drug currently under
investigation is thalidomide, which has many brand names and producers.
It was first used in the 1950s as a sedative but was pulled from the
market because it was found to cause birth defects. But, in the April
2006 issue of BMC Cell Biology, K.P. Tamilarasan, PhD, and colleagues
at the Anna University in Chennai, India reported that thalidomide
inhibits capillaries from branching off larger vessels. Additionally,
as reported by S. Vincent Rajkumar, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota in the January 2006 issue of Journal of Clinical
Oncology, thalidomide increased multiple myeloma patients&#8217; response
rate to induction therapy&#8212;the first treatment able to reduce the number
of cancer cells&#8212;by 20 percent. However, thalidomide caused greater risk
for adverse effects such as blood clots and fatigue. Regardless, the
results were powerful enough that, in May 2006, the FDA approved
thalidomide for multiple myeloma. In a preliminary trial, Levi S.
Downs, Jr., MD, medical director of the Women&#8217;s Health Center at the
University of Minnesota Medical School and Cancer Center, Minneapolis,
Minnesota, found that about 10 times as many of the women who had
ovarian cancer and were treated with thalidomide and the
chemotherapeutic topotecan decreased the number of cancerous cells as
compared to those treated with topotecan alone. Promisingly, the rate
of adverse effects was not significantly different between the two
groups. Currently, the use of thalidomide for cancer treatment is
mainly limited to clinical trials, and according to William D. Figg,
Sr., PharmD, head of the Molecular Pharmacology Section and the
Clinical Pharmacology Research Core at the National Cancer Institute,
&#8220;doctors are educating those seeking treatment of the known side
effects as they would for any drug&#8221; to reduce the chance of teratogenic
effects.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although anti-angiogenesis drugs have proven
valuable, they interfere with normal wound healing. Therefore,
according to Smith-McCune, &#8220;the doctors must stop treatment of the drug
a couple of weeks before surgery,&#8221; and likewise, not start up treatment
until &#8220;the surgical site is healed, which takes about two weeks.&#8221; Figg
also notes that &#8220;a large percent of patients develop hypertension who
receive Avastin®.&#8221; This can be a problem for many people who already
have high blood pressure. Another dilemma that Smith-McCune points to
is that women who take an anti-angiogenesis drug &#8220;cannot ovulate
normally [&#8230;] while on the drug.&#8221; This may become a serious problem if
used as &#8220;a chronic treatment, like insulin for diabetic patients,&#8221; for
patients in remission. Smith-McCune admits, however, that the drugs are
&#8220;better tolerated than chemotherapy.&#8221; Regardless of their promise, Figg
believes that &#8220;anti- angiogenesis drugs will never be monotherapy&#8221; and
will always be used in conjunction with &#8220;multiple drugs in a regime.&#8221;</small><br />
