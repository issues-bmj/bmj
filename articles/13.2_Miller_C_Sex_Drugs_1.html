<p style="text-align: center;">Second-hand exposure to opioids in the operating room</p>

<p><small><br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="surgery drug opioids operating room or" src="13.2_Miller_C_Sex_Drugs.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everyone knows that being a surgeon entails late nights, long hours,
and high amounts of stress &#8211; but few would expect opiate addiction to
be included in the job description. Nonetheless, a pioneering study
spearheaded by Priscilla McAuli&#64256;e, MD, PhD, of the University of
Florida&#8217;s School of Medicine, suggests just that. As reported in the
January 2006 edition of Medical Hypotheses, McAuli&#64256;e and colleagues
examined the relationship be- tween drug exposure in the operating room
and the development of substance abuse in physicians who were exposed
to drugs. They found that surgeons and anesthesiologists are at a much
higher risk for opiate addiction after second-hand exposure to the
medications fentanyl, which removes all sensation, and propofol, which
eases pain. The investigators found trace amounts of the drugs in the
air of the operating rooms, patient&#8217;s lungs, and the spaces above the
boxes holding the drug-containing syringes. Is this the missing link
between surgeons and opiate addiction, or is the addiction simply a
product of high stress and easy drug accessibility?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, well over 100,000 individuals across
the United States are dealing with opiate addiction at this time.
Physicians and those in the medical &#64257;eld are especially challenged with
addiction problems. McAuli&#64256;e reports that approximately 7.6 percent of
all physicians in Florida have undergone treatment for substance abuse
since 1980. This is an incredibly high proportion, especially
considering that it does not even include those who remain untreated.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past studies have linked several factors with the
high prevalence of addiction among physicians: high occupational
stress, easy access to medications, and inappropriate self-medication.
While it was previously thought that exhaled drugs were non-detectable
and did not cause addiction, McAuli&#64256;e&#8217;s new study suggests that experts
may need to consider an alternative view: second-hand exposure and
inadvertent sensitization to opiates in operating rooms may cause
addiction.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, McAuli&#64256;e and her colleagues compiled data
from addiction clinics in the state of Florida, focusing on drugs more
prone to being abused and recording the medical specialties of enrolled
physicians. They found that in 2002, 150 Florida-based physicians began
treatment for addiction. Though they account for only &#64257;ve percent of
the state&#8217;s licensed physicians, twelve percent of those physicians
undergoing substance abuse therapy were anesthesiologists or surgeons.
The researchers also discovered that 25 percent of the substances
abused by these physicians were opiates. When considering surgeons
alone, the proportion of opiate abuse skyrockets to an astonishing 40
percent. These &#64257;ndings satisfy one important criteria of the
second-hand exposure theory: because surgeons and anesthesiologists
spend more time in the operating room than other specialists, it is not
surprising that they have a higher risk of developing opiate addiction.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, of those physicians who reported being
addicted to fentanyl, 94.4 percent were surgeons and anesthesiologists.
McAuli&#64256;e and colleagues suggest that the bodies of physicians were
likely primed to the drug through inadvertent second-hand exposure to
opiate medications. As David Presti, PhD, professor of Neurobiology at
the University of California, Berkeley, explains, &#8220;Withdrawal could
have more devastating e&#64256;ects than the actual drug if someone has become
dependent on it. For me personally, I wouldn&#8217;t want my surgeon
operating on me while on opiates, but I wouldn&#8217;t want him going through
withdrawal either.&#8221;<br />
