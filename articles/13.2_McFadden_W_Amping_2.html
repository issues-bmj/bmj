<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Amping Up Your Memory</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; In these trials, a group of 16 males ages 18 to
35 were subjected to sleep-deprived conditions. First, each subject was
given a standardized period of sleep which ended at 7:00 am on the &#64257;rst
day of trial. Then, the subjects were then kept awake for the next 27
hours to induce sleepiness and impair cognitive abilities. At 11:00 PM
on the second day, the investigators administered varying doses of
CX717. The subjects were then tested at one hour intervals until 10:00
AM the next morning. The tests were used to monitor brainwaves, heart
rate, memory, reaction time, alertness, and problem solving abilities
of the subjects over the course of the trial. In order to standardize
the results, all of the subjects were exposed to each potential dosage
of ampakines with a two week interval between each test.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No abnormal changes occurred in the blood pressure
or the heart rate of subjects during the trial, contrasting
considerably with the e&#64256;ects of other commonly used stimulants. The
neurological tests demonstrated that CX717 a&#64256;ected cortical arousal and
improved memory while hindering abnormal systemic arousal. Remarkably,
the tests also demonstrated that the drugs produced little to no side
e&#64256;ects at the dosages administered, providing the essential evidence to
pursue further research and development of the drug on patients
su&#64256;ering from memory-related impairments.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the success of CX717, the prospects for
ampakine use are very promising. These drugs could lead to the
development of other drugs that are speci&#64257;cally intended to treat
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, narcolepsy, and Attention De&#64257;cit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March 2006, Cortex Pharmaceuticals revealed the
results of a phase II trial evaluating the e&#64256;ectiveness of CX717 in the
treatment of ADHD. The 68 subjects received either a placebo, a 200 mg
dose, or an 800 mg dose of CX717. The treatment was administered for
three weeks wherein a series of tests were used to determine the
subject&#8217;s placement on the ADHD rating scale (ADHD-RS). The subjects
who were given a high dose of CX717 experienced more than a 30 percent
decrease in ADHD-RS scores, indicating cognitive improvement. In the
wake of this success, Cortex Pharmaceuticals plans to pursue the
development of treatments for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the obvious clinical uses of ampakines, the
potential for the use of these drugs in the general public as
&#8220;pick-me-ups&#8221; for improving intelligence is sobering. If ampakines were
introduced as lifestyle drugs, ethical issues would arise concerning
meddling with the normal process of memory degradation. Some people
believe a line should be drawn between treating the sick and changing
the mental capacities of a whole population. The drugs&#8217; widespread
introduction into the population would introduce a new &#64257;eld that some
doctors have dubbed &#8220;cosmetic neurology.&#8221; Humans would have the
capacity to alter and enhance the mind with minimal side-e&#64256;ects.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poo believes that we are still very far from being
able to cosmetically doctor our brains. He explains that &#8220;the operation
of the nervous system is a very daring venture. We don&#8217;t know the
nervous system enough to alter its function.&#8221; He believes that with our
current knowledge of the brain, only life- threatening conditions are
worth the risk of manipulation and alteration of brain functions.
Additionally, Poo remarks that &#8220;the ability to do processing and
decision making is more important than memory retention, and that&#8217;s a
very selective part of the brain.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irrespective of the ongoing debate on the uses of
ampakines, one thing is certain: as more Americans grow older and face
the prospect of memory deterioration, many of them will be monitoring
the developments these memory enhancing drugs.<br />
