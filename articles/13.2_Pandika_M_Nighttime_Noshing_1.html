<p style="text-align: center;">Midnight snacks might not be so bad afterall</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Melissa Pandika<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">Spring 2006<br />
</p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="nighttime noshing" src="13.2_Pandika_M_Nighttime_Noshing.jpg.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rest assured, late-night eaters: recent primate studies reveal that
midnight snacking does not promote weight gain.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a widely-accepted belief that consuming food
late at night leads to an increase in weight. Incidentally, many
popular diet regimens recommend limiting nighttime caloric intake
because the metabolic rate of humans as well as other animals decreases
during periods of sleep.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to researchers at the Oregon National
Primate Research Center in Beaverton, this seemingly logical age-old
belief is largely &#64257;ction. In December 2005, a research team headed by
Judy L. Cameron, PhD, evaluated the percentage of daily calories
consumed at night by sixteen female rhesus monkeys placed on a weight
gain regimen for one year. Since increased caloric consumption and
weight gain have been associated with ovariectomy&#8212;surgical excision of
one or both ovaries&#8212;and adherence to a high-fat diet in numerous
species, Cameron and her colleagues &#64257;rst ovariectomized the monkeys and
then placed them on a high-fat diet to generate weight gain. Because
some of the monkeys ate approximately 65 percent of their total daily
calories at night, Cameron and her research team were able to observe
the e&#64256;ects of nighttime meals and compare the results with human eating
patterns.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study found no correlation between nighttime
caloric consumption and weight gain following the ovariectomy procedure
and implementation of the high-fat diet. Monkeys consuming a large
proportion of the calories at night did not exhibit an increased
tendency to gain weight and were neither substantially heavier nor
fatter than monkeys eating the majority of their calories in the
daytime. In other words, weight gain depended more on the total caloric
intake than on the time at which those calories were consumed.
Moreover, the study surprisingly found no correlation between the
change in the monkeys&#8217; caloric intake and the change in body weight in
response to the high-fat diet: some monkeys gained weight, some
remained lean, and a few even lost weight.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of correlation between calorie consumption
and body weight is due to various factors, but Cameron points primarily
to activity level. Highly active monkeys did not gain weight, whereas
extremely sedentary monkeys showed signi&#64257;cant weight gain. The results
of the study suggest, then, that individuals seeking to lose weight
should not rely solely on reducing evening caloric intake but should
also focus on reducing overall caloric intake and increasing activity
level.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just how applicable are the results of Cameron&#8217;s
monkey study to humans? Cameron maintains that the rhesus monkey is an
excellent model for humans in the genetic, physiological, and metabolic
sense. According to the National Institutes of Health&#8217;s February 2006
press release on the deposit of a draft of the rhesus macaque genome
sequence into free public databases, rhesus monkeys and humans share as
much as 95 percent of their genes. The two species also respond
similarly to high-fat and high-calorie diets, making the rhesus monkey
a popular animal model for adult-onset diabetes and atherosclerosis.
The monkeys used in Cameron&#8217;s research consumed 6 to 64 percent of
their total calories at night, similar to the 24 to 65 percent range of
nighttime caloric intake reported in humans.<br />
