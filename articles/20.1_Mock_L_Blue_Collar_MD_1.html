&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A medical epidemic has been accelerating throughout
the United States. Healthcare Finance News reported in December 2011
that all the large cardiology firms in the Columbus, Ohio area have
been purchased by hospitals. NPR.org reported in October 2010 that in
the Raleigh, North Carolina area, only 67 doctor practices remain that
are not affiliated with a hospital, and that within the next five
years, local hospital systems will have acquired the majority of them.
Data from the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) Annual
Physician Compensation and Production Survey reported that as recently
as 2005, more than two-thirds of medical practices were
physician-owned. In only three short years, that share had fallen to
below a half. Large hospital systems are rapidly absorbing private
medical practices, and this phenomenon leaves an uncertain impact for
both doctors and patients.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physicians are migrating to institutional employment
for a number of reasons. Many established doctors tire of the
time-consuming administrative frustrations in managing the complicated
billing and reimbursement system. Many clinicians are also wary of the
expensive new capital investments required for health information
management systems and other healthcare technologies. These investments
improve patient safety and quality of care, and have become de facto
requirements for running a viable and competitive practice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attitudes are also changing &#8211; the idea of working
nine to five in a hospital has become more acceptable to the new
generation of doctors. Long-practicing doctors lament that younger
colleagues are less willing to be on call or expend the long hours as
they did when they began practicing medicine. Instead, younger
physicians tend to value lifestyle balance and favor predictable hours.
For many new doctors who have graduated medical school with large
financial debt, protecting and stabilizing their income with steady,
salaried employment is a priority. In its 2011 Survey of Final-Year
Medical Residents, Merritt Hawkins &amp; Associates reported that in
2001, only 3 percent of medical residents preferred hospital
employment. This last year, 32 percent made institutional work their
first choice. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recession is also taking its toll on the private
practice. Fewer patients come in for care and more who do could not pay
their bills.&nbsp; An April 2011 MGMA letter to the U.S. House of
Representatives reported that the total operating cost per full time
equivalent physician has increased by 51 percent since 2001, while
Medicare physician payments have remained stagnant during that same
period. Insufficient reimbursement from insurance companies and
reductions in federal Medicare and Medicaid payments threaten the
revenue stream of a private practice and place severe pressure on
doctors to reduce operating costs to keep their businesses viable. With
a sharp decrease in federal reimbursements forecasted for 2012 and
beyond, the situation becomes dire for the independent physician.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor economics encouraged by national policy,
changes in attitudes in the new generation of doctors, and mounting
administrative burdens are motivating doctors to surrender the autonomy
and control of their private practices to seek employment at larger
organizations. This transition creates a positive feedback loop as
remaining doctors in private practice rush to sell their practices
before their peers sell out. Else, they risk prices for their own
practices falling, limiting their own exit options.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the cost side, national health policies continue
to reward efficient, integrated models of care that can better
coordinate services and elevate the quality of care while keeping costs
down through economies of scale. For example, hospitals can wield
market power by acquiring large quantities of supplies at the best
prices from vendors, optimize the use of expensive medical equipment
among many doctors, compete for the best doctors in the labor markets,
distribute the costs of acquisition and maintenance of expensive health
information management systems, or prevent repeated medical tests.
Institutions can theoretically offer patients the best possible care at
the lowest prices.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the revenue side, competitive, hospital systems
readily hire larger numbers of doctors. According to the MGMA&#8217;s 2010
Physician Placement Starting Salary Survey, half of doctors newly out
of residency or fellowships were hired by hospitals. Robert Kocher,
M.D. and Nikhil Sahni, in their May 2011 article, &#8220;Hospitals&#8217; Race to
Employ Physicians&#8221; in the New England Journal of Medicine, reported
that hospitals lose $150,000 to $250,000 per year over the first 3
years of employing a physician. However, after new physicians establish
themselves and build a network of referrals, hospitals expect to turn a
profit. In its 2010 Physician Inpatient/Outpatient Revenue Survey,
Merritt Hawkins &amp; Associates found that the average salary or
guarantee offered to a pediatrician is $171,000, while the average
annual inpatient/outpatient revenue generated by a pediatrician for
their affiliated hospitals is $856,154.&nbsp; A neurosurgeon will earn
$571,000 while bringing in $2,815,650. A large staff of doctors and
specialists who use hospital facilities guarantees over the long term a
steady flow of patient referrals, especially those with private
insurance, which typically pays more than federal programs.<br />
