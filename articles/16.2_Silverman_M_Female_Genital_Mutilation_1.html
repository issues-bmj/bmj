took its drama to a whole new level when one of the contestants,
Fatima, a young Somalian, revealed that she had been &#8220;circumcised&#8221; at
the age of seven. The girls &#8211; like most viewers in America &#8211; were
shocked, since most were unaware of the possibility of such a procedure
for women. Female genital mutilation (FGM) or &#8220;female circumcision,&#8221; is
a subject rarely discussed, particularly in the United States. While
FGM may be thought of as a problem specific to Africa, it is practiced
in regions throughout Asia, the Middle East, the Americas, and Europe
as well. In fact, there are an estimated 100 to 140 million young girls
and women worldwide who have fallen victim to FGM, and an additional
three million at risk annually. FGM is a serious health concern that
must be approached with cultural sensitivity, but also from a critical
and scientific perspective.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FGM has a long historical practice, dating back to
the time of the ancient Egyptians, who appeared to have had similar
practices. The most prevalent incidences of circumcision, however, are
linked to religious movements. Although religious groups and leaders
sometimes use religious texts to justify FGM, many scholars argue that
there is no mention or promotion of female circumcision in the Bible,
Torah, or Koran. Even male circumcision, widely practiced amongst Jews
and Muslims, is still a matter of great controversy. Male circumcision
involves the removal of part or the entire penile foreskin, but it is
widely accepted that both circumcised and uncircumcised males are still
able to achieve maximum sexual pleasure. In contrast, the clitoris is
unique in that it is designed exclusively for pleasure and therefore
has a very concentrated number of nerve endings that allow a woman to
experience sexual pleasure and orgasm. FGM targets the clitoris in
order to reduce the pleasure or an orgasm. FGM is divided into four
categories: clitoridectomy, excision, infibulation, and other.
Clitoridectomy is partial or total removal of the clitoris, while
excision is partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia.
Infibulation involves removal of the clitoris and labia and the
remaining tissue is sewn together with a small hole retained for
menstruation and urination. This hole is torn open and then re-sewn
during childbirth. Other forms of FGM as de fined by the World Health
Organization (WHO) include &#8220;all other harmful procedures to the female
genitalia for nonmedical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising,
scraping and cauterizing the genital area.&#8221; These procedures are
believed to reduce the likelihood that a woman will engage in
premarital sex, adultery, or masturbation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless, whether or not these procedures achieve
such a goal is secondary to the fact that they are enormously
detrimental to a women&#8217;s physical, mental, and emotional health. The
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) provides a comprehensive list of
the immediate effects, ranging from severe pain and shock to death, and
long-term consequences, such as the formation of cysts and abscesses,
infertility, and various mental illnesses. The risk of HIV/AIDS
transmission and infection is also increased, due to the unsanitary
conditions in which these procedures are usually performed and the
damage done to the reproductive organs and tissues.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the medical risks associated with
FGM seem to be enough reason to halt FGM, there are several other
factors continuing this practice. First, there is enormous pressure for
young girls to receive an FGM procedure. In many communities men only
want to marry girls who are &#8220;circumcised,&#8221; so parents are pressured to
push FGM on their daughters. Other cultural beliefs encouraging the
practice of FGM include a belief that the clitoris is poisonous to men
and children, that FGM can cure foul genital odors, prevent vaginal
cancer and homosexuality, and make a woman more beautiful. Some suggest
that it prevents HIV/AIDS, contrary to the studies showing otherwise.<br />
