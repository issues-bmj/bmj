<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Marijuana As Muse<br />
</small></p>
<br />
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alongside the redistribution of cerebral
blood flow in the brain, marijuana increases the levels of certain
neurotransmitters during intoxication. Neurotransmitters are chemicals
which activate different parts of the brain by binding to
neurotransmitter receptors located between neurons. Through binding,
the neurotransmitters cause their respective neurons to fire, resulting
in a signal which causes such physiological effects as happiness
(serotonin), memory acquisition (glutamate) and drunkenness
(GABA).&nbsp; Dopamine is one such neurotransmitter which exhibits an
increase in numbers during marijuana intoxication. Like serotonin,
dopamine is a major player in the production of euphoria, but states of
happiness are not the only positive results of dopamine release.
According to Flaherty, dopamine plays a major role in the promotion of
creativity by decreasing latent inhibition and promoting
novelty-seeking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Latent inhibition is the tendency to
disregard certain sensory stimuli that are deemed unimportant at the
present moment, thereby decreasing these stimuli&#8217;s influence on the
mind. For instance, in reading this article, you have probably
forgotten the feeling of sitting down in a chair, of hearing murmurs in
the next room, etc. By decreasing latent inhibition, dopamine
encourages human beings to, according to Flaherty, &#8220;find patterns in
what would otherwise be a disorienting barrage of sense data.&#8221; One of
dopamine&#8217;s effects, then, is to allow for an increased perceptual
awareness in which the colors, sounds and feelings of the world are
experienced to a heightened degree. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, dopamine promotes creativity via
the reward-reinforcement pathway by affecting the areas in the brain
associated with novelty-seeking. Novelty is a chief motivator for
creative individuals, and studies have shown dopamine to evoke within
us the desire to discover new ways of looking at the world, the notion
of creative drive again here arising. In promoting novelty-seeking,
dopamine encourages us to accomplish tasks that we want to accomplish.
Correlations between dopamine and novelty seeking were demonstrated in
a study performed in Israel using the Tridimensional Personality
Questionnaire (TPQ)&#8212;a test which measures four distinct domains of
temperament, including Novelty Seeking and Reward Dependence. It was
found that unrelated Israeli subjects who scored higher than average
Novelty Seeking test scores all exhibited the same physiological
tendency of increased dopamine release during creativity testing.
Similar results were reported in the Journal of Neuroscience in 2008.
In an experiment done on 34 healthy adults, results demonstrated
noticeable dopaminergic responses to novelty and other conditions
conducive to increased dopamine activity. <br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Kenneth Heilman, author of Creativity
and the Brain, notes: &#8220;&#8230;studies of large cohorts of college students
found that the students who use marijuana tend to be novelty seeking
and more creative than the students who did not use this drug.&#8221; This
connection between cannabis and novelty seeking is supported by studies
which reveal marijuana&#8217;s effect of increasing dopamine release in the
brain. THC is the major psychoactive substance in the cannabis plant
and has been shown to exhibit a dose-dependent effect on the firing
rate and burst firing of dopamine neurons within the brain. In a study
published in Neuropsychopharmacology in 2009, researchers sought to
discover the addictive properties of cannabis and found THC to induce
dopamine release in the human striatum. These studies are challenged,
however, by other research yielding results demonstrating no such
connection. Dr. Paul Strokes of Psychiatry Group and Imperial College
in London, for instance, studied the link between marijuana and the
development of schizophrenia by analyzing THC&#8217;s effect on
dopamine-related pathways, concluding that marijuana consumption did
not show any correlative effects on the rate or amount of dopamine
released in the striatum (2009). The stark contradiction between these
two studies must be put into context by noting that neither study had
more than 13 subjects involved in either experiment. This considered,
it is possible that marijuana generates creativity by increasing
dopamine release, but larger pools of test subjects are necessary
during further experimentation to draw more statistically-supported
conclusions to make this fact.<br />
