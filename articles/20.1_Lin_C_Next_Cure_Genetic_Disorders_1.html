&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Steven Finkbeiner, Professor at UCSF
School of Medicine, in 2011, Huntington disease (HD), an incurable,
neurological degenerative genetic disorder, afflicts at least 1 in
every 100,000 people worldwide.&nbsp; That means that at least 7
million people are currently diagnosed with HD. Despite at least twenty
years of research for finding a cure, there are &#8220;no curative
treatments...Huntington is not a traditional drug target - it is not a
protein or a receptor,&#8221; as stated by Dr. David Corey of University of
Texas, Southwestern, when interviewed.&nbsp; With the gradual
deterioration of the brain, HD patients slowly lose not only the
control of their body, but also the rest of her neural functions,
including basic thought process, speech capabilities, etc.However,
recently, using modified single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in gene silencing
has not only shown positive results in rats with Huntington Disease,
but also demonstrates its potential in treating Huntington Disease
patients and other genetically-linked diseases.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huntington Disease is due to the extensive
repetition of trinucleotide CAG, which codes for the amino acid
glutamine, on the huntington (HTT) gene, repeating consecutively up to
forty-five times. Repetitions can be long enough that the
peptide/polypeptide will bend onto itself into a hairpin structure.
Fortunately, this genetically linked disorder is localized on only one
gene. Therefore, to inhibit the expression of the gene, the ssRNA used
would only have to bind to it; a longer chain of repetitions would
increase its affinity to complementary RNA fragments that inhibit the
gene&#8217;s expression.&nbsp; Known inhibitors/antagonists include
single-stranded oligonucleotides (ASOs) and double stranded or duplex
RNAs (dsRNAs) and both have experimentally shown not only to alleviate
HD symptoms in rats, but also to yield &#8220;a sustained reversal of
phenotype&#8221;, suggesting &#8220;that silencing HTT expression can be productive
strategy for developing drugs to treat HD,&#8221; as reported by Dr. Corey.
However, there is more to silencing gene expression than simple binding
to repetitions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While HD is primarily inherited, some patients
express both mutant and wild-type (version found in nature) HTT
alleles, but inhibiting each one causes different results. Inhibiting
both may be a successful clinical strategy, and studies in mouse models
have shown that reducing both has the same benefits as reducing only
the mutant. However, multiple studies suggest that reducing one of the
alleles, the wild-type, may have deleterious effects. Developing,
allele-selective inhibitors that maximize reduction of mutant HTT and
minimize loss of wild-type HTT would be ideal in treating HD.1 To
target the mutant version specifically, single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) are utilized, allowing dsRNAs to decipher between wild and
mutant HTT. SNPs are loci on genes or snippets of DNA sequences that
differ by only one nucleotide. While the majority of SNPs is unique to
the individual, there are a few universal SNPs that can be used to
treat HD patients.&nbsp; Another approach to distinguishing between
wild-type and mutant is taking advantage of the number of repetitions.
Mutant HTT have significantly longer chains of repeats than those of
the wild-type. In turn, multiple/more ASOs can bind to the mutant HTT
in comparison to the number of ASOs bounded to the wild-type. While
this method would be the easiest and effective, experimental results
unfortunately showed that ASOs&#8217; selectivity did not exceed 4-8 fold
when comparing to other methods. To compensate for such low
selectivity, researchers are changing their silencing strategy to RNA
interference (RNAi), involving the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA).<br />
