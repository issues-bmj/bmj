<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from Memoirs of an Electron</small></p>
<p><small><br />
</small></p>
<p><small> &nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, Gary Schwartz, PhD, professor of
psychology, psychiatry, neurology, surgery, and medicine at University
of Arizona has proposed the systemic memory theory, which argues that
memory is not stored at the protein level, but rather at the subatomic
level. This theory suggests that memory can be stored in organs via
electrons and photons. According to Dr. Schwartz, in each energy
interaction, the two particles involved&#8212;specifically, photons and
electrons&#8212;inevitably share information and energy in such a way that
any future relationships between the two particles will evolve from
that instance. To illustrate the basic principle of feedback, Dr.
Schwartz explains that when a video camera is pointed at a TV that is
broadcasting the image of the video camera, the TV will show multiple
images of itself, one inside the other. Dr. Schwartz explains that just
as the video camera has the ability to record and update images of
light, so are electrons constantly storing and updating information
about the history of their interactions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The systemic memory theory thus predicts that atoms,
which contain electrons, are constantly &#8220;remembering&#8221; and &#8220;updating&#8221;
information about their surroundings and that organs contain a more
complex memory that is retained by these electrons. From this idea, it
might be said that a person&#8217;s soul or memories from his life continue
to live on even after the body dies because the electrons will always
have the &#8220;memory&#8221; of their interactions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But can the lifeless, physical memories of
individual electrons combine to form the full-scale, animated memory of
a human being? As Dr. Stent puts it, &#8220;Personality is a complex
shmeligan of workings in the brain; although it is possible that
personalities could be passed from person to person, it is highly
unlikely, unless a brain is transplanted.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Budinger offers a few other possibilities that
indicate that hormonal action could be the reason for this alteration
of behavior. Hormone disruption can occur both naturally, as in the
case of the body&#8217;s interaction with the new organ, and unnaturally, as
in the case of the injection of hormones into the body. Naturally,
cells of transplanted organs always interact with cells of the
recipient&#8217;s body by traveling to other parts of it, while cells in the
recipient&#8217;s body may also go into the transplanted organ. This exchange
of cells produces chimeras, or organs consisting of tissues with
different genetic composition. Likewise, it is not unusual for a female
heart transplanted into a male body to eventually contain cells with
both X and Y chromosomes. Therefore, it is understandable that any
hormonal imbalances or chemical processes characteristic of the cells
of a donor may be passed on to a recipient at the organ level.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hormonal imbalances introduced to the recipient&#8217;s
body are not caused solely by the donated organ. Since donated organs
contain foreign cells, the recipient&#8217;s immune system will react to it
by producing hormones that trigger defense mechanisms. To prevent a
detrimental immune reaction to the transplanted organ, doctors often
prescribe immunosuppressive drugs after the operation. Immunotherapy
may alter a patient&#8217;s behavior or personality, because
immunosuppressive drugs affect the production and recycling of hormones
throughout the body. &#8220;Changes in behavior may also be attributed to
endogenous biochemical abnormalities resulting from problems with the
metabolism of the liver,&#8221; says Dr. Budinger. One of the liver&#8217;s main
functions is to break down hormones; when the liver&#8217;s metabolism is
abnormal or when there are too many hormones for the liver to break
down, the hormones go back into the bloodstream, ultimately leading
them back to the brain. In the case of dopamine buildup, disorders such
as schizophrenia may occur.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite all we have learned through scientific
research, humans still do not know completely where behaviors,
passions, and memories are stored or even what they really are. Perhaps
memories are simply stored in the brain as extremely stable proteins,
or perhaps they are a complex amalgamation of the individual &#8220;memories&#8221;
of electrons and photons. As Dr. Schwartz puts it, &#8220;We&#8217;ve been looking
in the wrong place this whole time.&#8221;<br />
