<p style="text-align: center;">Certified Nurse-Midwives: An Alternative Choice</p>

<p><small><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="nurse midwives cnm birth child" src="16.1_Medina_A_Midwives_Helping.jpg.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While having a baby can be simultaneously joyous and stressful, it is
undoubtedly one of the greatest life-changing events. An obstetrician
is the commonly preferred choice when choosing a practitioner to guide
a neonate into this world. Yet, an increasing number of individuals are
opting for an alternative choice: the certified nurse-midwife (CNM).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although most individuals understand the role of an
obstetrician during the childbirth process, the role of the CNM is less
well-known. There is a common misconception that the majority of
CNM-attended births occur in the mother&#8217;s home or in birthing centers.
However, in 2005, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics, 96.6 percent of CNM-attended births actually occurred in
hospitals. Furthermore, the National Center for Health Statistics
reports that the use of CNMs is on the rise, as the number of
CNM-attended births has increased nearly every year since 1975, when
midwife-attended births were first recorded. In 1975, CNMs delivered
approximately 0.6 percent of all births, but by 2005 this number had
risen to 7.4 percent.<br />
<br />
As certified birth attendants, both CNMs and obstetricians share a
similar scope of practice that includes diagnosis, therapy management,
risk reduction, family planning, and gynecological care. However, it is
the differences in their approach and ideology that truly distinguish
these two types of practitioners from each other and their ultimate
effect on maternal and neonatal outcomes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a study published in the September 1995 issue of
Journal of Nurse-Midwifery, Deborah Oakley, PhD, University of Michigan
at Ann Arbor, comments on these two divergent models of care. Oakley
observes that the CNM approach emphasizes education, psychosocial care,
and a restrained, individualized approach to technology, whereas the
obstetrician approach emphasizes a more routine use of state-of-the-art
technology.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leslie Cragin, CNM, PhD, University of California,
San Francisco, further emphasizes the differences between the two
practitioner groups: &#8220;CNMs believe birth is a normal health and life
process. The best outcomes are achieved if interventions are performed
only when medically necessary. CNMs often feel medical doctors are too
eager to intervene.&#8221; Cragin believes that many medical physicians focus
on &#8220;curing illness and do not allow for normal processes to occur.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oakley&#8217;s research focuses on the maternal and
neonatal outcomes of women planning a hospital birth attended by a CNM,
in comparison to physician-supervised births, to determine if
differences in care providers engender differences in medical processes
and health outcomes. In these various studies, the two groups of women
whom Oakley examined generally shared similar pregnancy and health risk
factors, allowing for a more statistically reliable comparison.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the approach to physical prenatal care, some
distinctions and similarities were identified between the two provider
groups. Oakley observed that women in the physician group had
significantly more ultrasounds than the women in the CNM group, 1.7
percent compared to 0.9 percent. Additionally, she found that 37
percent of the physician group, compared to 28 percent of the CNM
group, had physiological tests performed such as X-rays and other
laboratory assessments of conditions not specific to pregnancy.
However, Oakley states that the number of women receiving
pregnancy-related tests such as nonstress tests, contraction stress
tests, and amniocentesis did not significantly differ between the two
provider groups. Cragin believes that the increased number of tests
within the physician cohort can be attributed to both practitioner
ideology and a societal preference for use of medical technologies.<br />
