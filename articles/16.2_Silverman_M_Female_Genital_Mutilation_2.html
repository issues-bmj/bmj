<p style="font-style: italic;"><small>continued from The War on Female Genital Mutiliation<br />
</small></p>
<p><small><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to research by Sarah Rodriguez on the
history of female circumcision in the Journal of the History of
Medicine and Allied Sciences in December 2007, physicians in the United
States practiced FGM for many years, performing clitoridectomys if a
woman behaved outside of the female norms &#8220;by masturbating or by not
responding to her husband&#8217;s affections.&#8221; Medical journals reveal that
clitoridectomys were used to treat women&#8217;s &#8220;problems&#8221; including
hysteria, epilepsy, masturbation, nymphomania, melancholia, and
homosexuality as recently as the 1950s. In 1990, according to the
Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 168,000 women and girls in
the United States had undergone FGM.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the international community recognizes FGM as
a violation of human rights. The WHO states that &#8220;the practice reflects
deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme
form of discrimination against women,&#8221; also recognizing that FGM &#8220;has
no health benefits and harms girls and women in many ways.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last decade, much more information regarding
FGM has been uncovered. In June 2001, the Office of the Senior
Coordinator for International Women&#8217;s Issues of the United States
Department of State released some of the first thorough data and
analysis of FGM practice, specifically in countries throughout Africa.
In 2000, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) funded a
series of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in Egypt. Of
the 15,648 women, ages 15 to 49, who participated, nearly 97 percent
had undergone some type of FGM. The DHS also found that about 75
percent of women thought the practice should continue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, millions of women are living with FGM. A
procedure is available to reconstruct a new clitoris, leading to
restored sensation and sexual pleasure. This remarkable, but costly,
surgery is currently being introduced at the Yalgado Ouedraogo
University Hospital in Burkina Faso.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FGM is a unique issue because it is not only one of
health, but of children&#8217;s, women&#8217;s, and human rights as well. It is
just as much a cultural, religious, educational, economic, legal, and
moral dilemma as is it one of health. For this very reason, appropriate
sectors should collaborate to address the underlying problems
potentially causing FGM. Because FGM is such a multifaceted issue,
great amounts of advocacy and financial resources can be pooled, not
only by health organizations, but also by feminist groups, child
advocacy agencies, and other institutions. Cooperative forces such as
Lawyers Without Borders should provide their services just as the
health organizations have done to make the fight against a FGM a truly
holistic and effective one.<br />
